Common law legal systems place great value on deciding cases according to consistent principled rules so that similar facts will yield similar and predictable outcomes , and observance of precedent is the mechanism by which that goal is attained . The principle by which judges are bound to precedents is known as stare decisis . Black 's Law Dictionary defines `` precedent '' as a `` rule of law established for the first time by a court for a particular type of case and thereafter referred to in deciding similar cases '' . Common law precedent is a third kind of law , on equal footing with statutory law ( statutes and codes enacted by legislative bodies ) , and delegated legislation ( in U.K. parlance ) or regulatory law ( in U.S. parlance ) ( regulations promulgated by executive branch agencies ) .", "question_text": "what were local court decisions based upon in the early english courts", "title_text": "Precedent", "answer_spans": [[32, 41]], "answer_text": ["precedent"], "annotation": [], "sentence_starts": [0, 251, 499, 581, 779], "answer_type": "multi_sentence"}

The two largest combatant groups were the Red Army , fighting for the Bolshevik form of socialism led by Vladimir Lenin , and the loosely allied forces known as the White Army , which included diverse interests favoring monarchism , capitalism and alternative forms of socialism , each with democratic and antidemocratic variants . In addition , rival militant socialists and nonideological Green armies fought against both the Bolsheviks and the Whites . Eight foreign nations intervened against the Red Army , notably the Allied Forces and the pro-German armies . The Red Army defeated the White Armed Forces of South Russia in Ukraine and the army led by Admiral Aleksandr Kolchak in Siberia in 1919 . The remains of the White forces commanded by Pyotr Nikolayevich Wrangel were beaten in Crimea and evacuated in late 1920 . Lesser battles of the war continued on the periphery for two more years , and minor skirmishes with the remnants of the White forces in the Far East continued well into 1923 . The war ended in 1923 in the sense that Red control of the newly formed Soviet Union was now assured , although armed national resistance in Central Asia was not completely crushed until 1934 .

Writing of his early experiences in the colonies in 1778 , Paine `` found the disposition of the people such , that they might have been led by a thread and governed by a reed . Their attachment to Britain was obstinate , and it was , at that time , a kind of treason to speak against it . Their ideas of grievance operated without resentment , and their single object was reconciliation . '' Paine quickly engrained himself in the Philadelphia newspaper business , and began writing Common Sense in late 1775 under the working title of Plain Truth . Though it began as a series of letters to be published in various Philadelphia papers , it grew too long and unwieldy to publish as letters , leading Paine to select the pamphlet form . Benjamin Rush recommended the publisher Robert Bell , promising Paine that , where other printers might balk at the content of the pamphlet , Bell would not hesitate nor delay its printing . Bell zealously promoted the pamphlet in Philadelphia 's papers , and demand grew so high as to require a second printing . Paine , overjoyed with its success , endeavored to collect his share of the profits and donate them to purchase mittens for General Montgomery 's troops , then encamped in frigid Quebec . However , when Paine 's chosen intermediaries audited Bell 's accounts , they found that the pamphlet actually had made zero profits . Incensed , Paine ordered Bell not to proceed on a second edition , as he had planned several appendices to add to Common Sense . Bell ignored this and began advertising a `` new edition '' . While Bell believed this advertisement would convince Paine to retain his services , it had the opposite effect . Paine secured the assistance of the Bradford brothers , publishers of the Pennsylvania Evening Post , and released his new edition , featuring several appendices and additional writings . Bell began working on a second edition . This set off a month - long public debate between Bell and the still - anonymous Paine , conducted within the pages and advertisements of the Pennsylvania Evening Post , with each party charging the other with duplicity and fraud .

For example , the melting point and freezing point of mercury is 234.32 kelvins ( \u2212 38.83 \u00b0 C or \u2212 37.89 \u00b0 F ) . However , certain substances possess differing solid - liquid transition temperatures . For example , agar melts at 85 \u00b0 C ( 185 \u00b0 F ) and solidifies from 31 \u00b0 C ( 88 \u00b0 F ; 304 K ) ; such direction dependence is known as hysteresis .
