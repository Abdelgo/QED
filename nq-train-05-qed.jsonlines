{"example_id": -8520587718579281808, "paragraph_text": "Francis Hopkinson of New Jersey , a naval flag designer , and a signer of the Declaration of Independence , designed the 1777 flag while he was the Chairman of the Continental Navy Board 's Middle Department , sometime between his appointment to that position in November 1776 and the time that the flag resolution was adopted in June 1777 . The Navy Board was under the Continental Marine Committee . Not only did Hopkinson claim that he designed the U.S. flag , but he also claimed that he designed a flag for the U.S. Navy . Hopkinson was the only person to have made such a claim during his own lifetime , when he sent a letter and several bills to Congress for his work . These claims are documented in the Journals of the Continental Congress and George Hasting 's biography of Hopkinson . Hopkinson initially wrote a letter to Congress , via the Continental Board of Admiralty , on May 25 , 1780 . In this letter , he asked for a `` Quarter Cask of the Public Wine '' as payment for designing the U.S. flag , the seal for the Admiralty Board , the seal for the Treasury Board , Continental currency , the Great Seal of the United States , and other devices . However , in three subsequent bills to Congress , Hopkinson asked to be paid in cash , but he did not list his U.S. flag design . Instead , he asked to be paid for designing the `` great Naval Flag of the United States '' in the first bill ; the `` Naval Flag of the United States '' in the second bill ; and `` the Naval Flag of the States '' in the third , along with the other items . The flag references were generic terms for the naval ensign that Hopkinson had designed , that is , a flag of seven red stripes and six white ones . The predominance of red stripes made the naval flag more visible against the sky on a ship at sea . By contrast , Hopkinson 's flag for the United States had seven white stripes , and six red ones -- in reality , six red stripes laid on a white background . Hopkinson 's sketches have not been found , but we can make these conclusions because Hopkinson incorporated different stripe arrangements in the Admiralty ( naval ) Seal that he designed in the Spring of 1780 and the Great Seal of the United States that he proposed at the same time . His Admiralty Seal had seven red stripes ; whereas , his second U.S. Seal proposal had seven white ones . Hopkinson 's flag for the Navy is the one that the Nation preferred as the national flag . Remnants of Hopkinson 's U.S. flag of seven white stripes can be found in the Great Seal of the United States and the President 's seal . When Hopkinson was chairman of the Navy Board , his position was like that of today 's Secretary of the Navy . The payment was not made , however , because it was determined he had already received a salary as a member of Congress . This contradicts the legend of the Betsy Ross flag , which suggests that she sewed the first Stars and Stripes flag by request of the government in the Spring of 1776 . Furthermore , a letter from the War Board to George Washington on May 10 , 1779 , documents that there was still no design established for a national flag for the Army 's use in battle .", "question_text": "who made the american flag and what year was it", "title_text": "Flag of the United States", "answer_spans": [[0, 125]], "answer_text": ["Francis Hopkinson of New Jersey , a naval flag designer , and a signer of the Declaration of Independence , designed the 1777"], "annotation": [], "sentence_starts": [0, 342, 402, 528, 677, 796, 905, 1166, 1296, 1554, 1703, 1803, 1961, 2247, 2353, 2444, 2582, 2693, 2815, 2984], "answer_type": "multi_sentence"}

They found that bacteriophage growing within an infected bacterium could be modified , so that upon their release and re-infection of a related bacterium the bacteriophage 's growth is restricted ( inhibited ) ( also described by Luria in his autobiography on pages 45 and 99 in 1984 ) . In 1953 , Jean Weigle and Giuseppe Bertani reported similar examples of host - controlled modification using different bacteriophage systems . Later work by Daisy Roulland - Dussoix and Werner Arber in 1962 and many other subsequent workers led to the understanding that restriction was due to attack and breakdown of the modified bacteriophage 's DNA by specific enzymes of the recipient bacteria . As reviewed by Daniel Nathans and Hamilton O. Smith in 1975 , this work resulted in the discovery of the class of enzymes now known as restriction enzymes . When these enzymes were isolated in the laboratory they could be used for controlled manipulation of DNA , thus providing the foundation for the development of genetic engineering . Werner Arber , Daniel Nathans , and Hamilton Smith were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1978 for their work on restriction - modification .", "question_text": "what are produced by bacteria and cut dna at specific points", "title_text": "Restriction modification system", "answer_spans": [[1089, 1108]], "answer_text": ["restriction enzymes"], "annotation": [], "sentence_starts": [0, 189, 266, 554, 697, 954, 1111, 1293], "answer_type": "multi_sentence"}
