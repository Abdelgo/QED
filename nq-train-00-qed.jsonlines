A series of follow - up battles ( First Masurian Lakes ) destroyed most of the First Army as well and kept the Russians off balance until the spring of 1915 . The battle is particularly notable for fast rail movements by the Germans , enabling them to concentrate against each of the two Russian armies in turn , and also for the failure of the Russians to encode their radio messages .

' A ' ending : ' A ' swipes the key from underneath Ezra 's doormat . 22 22 `` For Whom the Bell Tolls '' Lesli Linka Glatter I. Marlene King March 21 , 2011 ( 2011 - 03 - 21 ) 3.64 Now that Aria , Emily , Hanna , and Spencer are in possession of the information that Alison left them , the girls decide that it 's time to finally put an end to `` A '' and the mystery surrounding their friend . They turn to Jenna , finding out what Alison spoke to her about in the hospital ; how she threatened Jenna with the video if she did n't keep their secret . Hanna is confused when she is told by her mother that Caleb was going to the festival to give her a letter before he left town . Mona tries covering it up but when she is having a mysterious phone call about Hanna 's well - being , Lucas tells her she 's wrong and Hanna deserves to be happy . Spencer buys a prepaid phone to tell Ian that they found the video and to come to the park with $10,000 . Aria 's mother has a get together with all of the teachers , but Aria is shocked to see Ezra 's past love show up . Spencer is shunned when she cracks a joke about Melissa 's baby 's christening , but regrets it since the baby is just Ian 's spawn , not Ian . Jenna is shown worrying about the repercussions of the video getting out into society , and it is revealed that she is secretly dating Garret , who consoles her and promises to keep her safe . When Melissa ( stood up at the church by Ian ) senses something wrong and can not find her phone , Spencer offers to drive her to the church to find her phone , but they get into a car accident , leaving Melissa 's baby in danger . After Emily , Hanna , Aria , and Garret go to the park to find Ian , a messenger shows up giving them the money instead of Ian . Back at the church searching for Melissa 's phone , Spencer finds Ian instead . He chases her up the stairs and attacks her , revealing that it was Ian who said he pushed Alison knocking her unconscious , even though Spencer knows Alison died of suffocation . Ian pushes Spencer but she latches onto his leg , screaming for help . A hooded figure comes up to them , and Ian questions why he / she is there . The figure pushes Ian , making him plummet to his death . When the police show up to get the body , they think the girls are lying because Ian is nowhere to be found . But without certain proof , they can not justify that he was actually there attempting to murder Spencer . As the girls walk out of the church , still shaken about the near death experience , they receive a text from A stating , `` It 's not over until I say it is . Sleep tight while you still can , bitches . - A .

This work is an imaginative and fanciful account of British kings from the legendary Trojan exile Brutus to the 7th - century Welsh king Cadwallader . Geoffrey places Arthur in the same post-Roman period as do Historia Brittonum and Annales Cambriae . He incorporates Arthur 's father , Uther Pendragon , his magician advisor Merlin , and the story of Arthur 's conception , in which Uther , disguised as his enemy Gorlois by Merlin 's magic , sleeps with Gorlois 's wife Igerna at Tintagel , and she conceives Arthur . On Uther 's death , the fifteen - year - old Arthur succeeds him as King of Britain and fights a series of battles , similar to those in the Historia Brittonum , culminating in the Battle of Bath . He then defeats the Picts and Scots before creating an Arthurian empire through his conquests of Ireland , Iceland and the Orkney Islands . After twelve years of peace , Arthur sets out to expand his empire once more , taking control of Norway , Denmark and Gaul . Gaul is still held by the Roman Empire when it is conquered , and Arthur 's victory naturally leads to a further confrontation between his empire and Rome 's . Arthur and his warriors , including Kaius ( Kay ) , Beduerus ( Bedivere ) and Gualguanus ( Gawain ) , defeat the Roman emperor Lucius Tiberius in Gaul but , as he prepares to march on Rome , Arthur hears that his nephew Modredus ( Mordred ) -- whom he had left in charge of Britain -- has married his wife Guenhuuara ( Guinevere ) and seized the throne .

However , a therapist by the name Eli James dies , and Melinda witnesses his soul being brought back . This ' near - death ' experience grants him the ability to hear ghosts . The episode is focused on the ghost of one of Eli 's patients , who was possibly more than that , and whether or not she has been starting fires since she was 12 .

Monty eventually deduces that he will need to access the inside of their firewall to get it done ; Echo , who has decided not to turn in any of the defectors , offers to instead go undercover as a defector so that she can breach Diyoza 's camp and get Monty into the firewall . Octavia eventually agrees , but still sends Cooper to shoot defectors as they attempt to leave Polis . Emori attempts to remove Murphy 's shock collar , initially without luck . During their time , he asks why she broke up with him . She tells him that he pushed her away , which he says was due to her spending more time with Raven , which apparently made him jealous . Eventually , they get the collar removed and set up an explosive trap for McReary and two other Eligius prisoners . Successful , they kiss and almost sleep together , before McReary emerges from the explosion , alive . They decide to keep him as a hostage . Clarke becomes paranoid that Octavia will figure out that Madi is a true Nightblood , given that Niylah and Gaia both figured it out . She tells Madi that they 're going to go with the defectors , but Madi points out that doing so would likely result in Diyoza killing Clarke . Clarke insists that the risk is worth it , but Madi ends up going to Octavia with the truth to protect Clarke . Octavia tells Clarke that she wo n't allow anything to happen to Madi , but that Madi will now train as a new Wonkru warrior . Echo successfully infiltrates Diyoza 's coup , though she and the other defectors are made to wear shock collars . 65 7 `` Acceptable Losses '' Mairzee Almas Jeff Vlaming June 19 , 2018 ( 2018 - 06 - 19 ) TBA TBD 66 8 `` How We Get to Peace '' Antonio Negret Lauren Muir June 26 , 2018 ( 2018 - 06 - 26 ) TBA TBD", "question_text": "when does the new episode of the 100", "title_text": "List of The 100 episodes", "answer_spans": [[8282, 8296]], "answer_text": ["June 26 , 2018"], "annotation": [], "sentence_starts": [], "answer_type": "multi_sentence"}

An association was formed in 1875 , which dissolved after seven years , but in 1886 the Hockey Association was formed by seven London clubs and representatives from Trinity College , Cambridge .

In the miniature a kneeling lover ( or more precisely , an allegory of the lover 's `` sweet gaze '' or douz regart ) offers his heart to a damsel . The heart here resembles a pine cone ( held `` upside down '' , the point facing upward ) , in accord with medieval anatomical descriptions . However , in this miniature what suggests a heart shape is only the result of a lover 's finger superimposed on an object ; the full shape outline of the object is partly hidden , and therefore unknown . Moreover , the French title of the manuscript that features the miniature translates into `` Novel Of The Pear '' in English . Thus the heart shaped object would be a pear ; the conclusion that a pear represents a heart is dubious . Opinions therefore differ over this being the first depiction of a heart as symbol of romantic love . Giotto in his 1305 painting in the Scrovegni Chapel ( Padua ) shows an allegory of charity ( caritas ) handing her heart to Jesus Christ . This heart is also depicted in the pine cone shape based on anatomical descriptions of the day ( still held `` upside down '' ) . Giotto 's painting exerted considerable influence on later painters , and the motive of Caritas offering a heart is shown by Taddeo Gaddi in Santa Croce , by Andrea Pisano on the bronze door of the south porch of the Baptisterium in Florence ( c. 1337 ) , by Ambrogio Lorenzetti in the Palazzo Publico in Siena ( c. 1340 ) and by Andrea da Firenze in Santa Maria Novella in Florence ( c. 1365 ) .

Its origin is attributed to English author Horace Walpole , with his 1764 novel The Castle of Otranto , subtitled ( in its second edition ) `` A Gothic Story '' . The effect of Gothic fiction feeds on a pleasing sort of terror , an extension of Romantic literary pleasures that were relatively new at the time of Walpole 's novel . It originated in England in the second half of the 18th century where , following Walpole , it was further developed by Clara Reeve , Ann Radcliffe , William Thomas Beckford and Matthew Lewis . The genre had much success in the 19th century , as witnessed in prose by Mary Shelley 's Frankenstein and the works of Edgar Allan Poe as well as Charles Dickens with his novella , A Christmas Carol , and in poetry in the work of Samuel Taylor Coleridge , Lord Byron and Poe . Another well known novel in this genre , dating from the late Victorian era , is Bram Stoker 's Dracula . The name Gothic refers to the ( pseudo ) - medieval buildings , emulating Gothic architecture , in which many of these stories take place . This extreme form of romanticism was very popular in England and Germany . The English Gothic novel also led to new novel types such as the German Schauerroman and the French Georgia .", "question_text": "during what time in history were gothic stories popular", "title_text": "Gothic fiction", "answer_spans": [[739, 755]], "answer_text": ["the 19th century"], "annotation": [{"context_entity_text": "The genre", "context_entity_span": [709, 718], "question_entity_text": "gothic stories", "question_entity_span": [33, 47]}], "sentence_starts": [0, 183, 346, 515, 709, 987, 1093, 1233, 1308], "answer_type": "single_sentence"}

According to Jagger , `` the names ( in the song ) are historical , but it was really unconscious that they should fit together from the same period . '' At the time , it was widely thought that an inspiration for the song was Jane Ormsby - Gore , daughter of David Ormsby - Gore , former British ambassador in Washington , who later married Michael Rainey , founder of the Hung on You boutique in Chelsea that was frequented by the Stones . Its most impactful development was by Jones , no longer the principal musical force for the band , searching for methods to improve upon The Rolling Stones ' musical textures . He expressed an intrigue in incorporating culturally diverse instruments into the band 's music , investigating the sitar , koto , marimba , and testing electronics . In the press Jones talked about applying the Appalachian dulcimer into compositions , although he seemed uncertain of the instrument , saying `` It 's an old English instrument used at the beginning of the century '' . The dulcimer was first brought to his attention in March 1966 when Jones began listening to recordings of Richard Fari\u00f1a . The influence of these recordings would manifest itself in Aftermath , where Jones performed with the dulcimer on two tracks , `` I Am Waiting '' and , more distinctively , `` Lady Jane '' . This later contributed to Jones 's status as an early pioneer in world music , and effectively shifted the band from blues rock to a versatile pop group .", "question_text": "what is the rolling stones song lady jane about", "title_text": "Lady Jane (song)", "answer_spans": [[424, 442]], "answer_text": ["Jane Ormsby - Gore"], "annotation": [], "sentence_starts": [0, 197, 351, 639, 816, 983, 1202, 1325, 1516], "answer_type": "multi_sentence"}

She produced the first genetic map for maize , linking regions of the chromosome to physical traits .

{"example_id": -4407124027501847756, "paragraph_text": "Like many of Keats 's odes , `` Ode on a Grecian Urn '' discusses art and art 's audience . He relied on depictions of natural music in earlier poems , and works such as `` Ode to a Nightingale '' appeal to auditory sensations while ignoring the visual . Keats reverses this when describing an urn within `` Ode on a Grecian Urn '' to focus on representational art . He previously used the image of an urn in `` Ode on Indolence '' , depicting one with three figures representing Love , Ambition and Poesy . Of these three , Love and Poesy are integrated into `` Ode on a Grecian Urn '' with an emphasis on how the urn , as a human artistic construct , is capable of relating to the idea of `` Truth '' . The images of the urn described within the poem are intended as obvious depictions of common activities : an attempt at courtship , the making of music , and a religious rite . The figures are supposed to be beautiful , and the urn itself is supposed to be realistic . Although the poem does not include the subjective involvement of the narrator , the description of the urn within the poem implies a human observer that draws out these images . The narrator interacts with the urn in a manner similar to how a critic would respond to the poem , which creates ambiguity in the poem 's final lines : `` ' Beauty is truth , truth beauty , ' -- that is all / Ye know on earth , and all ye need to know . '' The lack of a definite voice of the urn causes the reader to question who is really speaking these words , to whom they are speaking , and what is meant by the words , which encourages the reader to interact with the poem in an interrogative manner like the narrator .", "question_text": "who wrote beauty is truth truth is beauty", "title_text": "Ode on a Grecian Urn", "answer_spans": [[255, 260]], "answer_text": ["Keats"], "annotation": [], "sentence_starts": [0, 92, 255, 367, 508, 705, 882, 974, 1152, 1410], "answer_type": "multi_sentence"}

{"example_id": 3612937516494892212, "paragraph_text": "Steve Williams ( voiced by David Herman ) -- Steve is an overconfident , bumbling park ranger who takes himself and his job way too seriously . Even though he has been `` Ranger of the Month '' at Brickleberry for several years , he does not appear to display good skills or even common sense . Steve 's `` Ranger of the Month '' title means everything to him and he will do anything to keep it . Despite his extreme lack of intelligence , he knows the Brickleberry park very well because his father was also a Brickleberry ranger , so Steve was raised in the park . He dreamed of working at Brickleberry since he was a child in order to follow in his father 's footsteps . He is shown to have a man crush on Viggo Mortensen . Woodrow `` Woody '' Johnson ( voiced by Tom Kenny ) -- Woody is a 55 - year - old , abrasive ranger with a military background . In the `` Crippleberry '' episode , he mentions to Steve that he is technically a war criminal . He worked his way up to head ranger over his 30 - year career at Brickleberry . He worked alongside Steve 's father , but never searched for him when Jonah went missing . He always has the park 's best interest in mind and struggles to boost the dwindling tourism numbers by any means . In `` 2 Weeks Notice '' , he accidentally confesses to Malloy that when his mother died , his father forced him to dress up in her lingerie , implying that he may have been sexually abused by his father . It is also revealed in season 2 that Woody was a former porn star named Rex Erection . Ethel Anderson ( voiced by Kaitlin Olson in season 1 , Natasha Leggero in season 2 and 3 ) -- Ethel is an attractive , 25 - year - old female ranger . She was the top ranger at Yellowstone and was transferred to Brickleberry in an effort to get the park back on track ( and because she was fired from Yellowstone for being drunk on the job ) . She is passionate for animals and nature and does her best to treat her co-workers kindly . Steve sees Ethel as a threat to his Ranger of the Month title , while Ethel sees Steve as a bumbling idiot . Ethel possesses extraordinary ranger skills , but is much more humble than Steve . Denzel Jackson ( voiced by Jerry Minor ) -- Denzel is a black ranger who is horrible at his job , but ca n't be fired because he works for a government agency . Denzel is a gerontophile , which occasionally gets him into hot water . Denzel finds his job challenging because he 's afraid of bugs , snakes , and pretty much anything else that inhabits the woods . It was revealed in the first season that his father and father 's father and grandfather 's father were undercover cops , but Denzel has no interest in following in their footsteps . For the rest of the series it is not mentioned again . Connie Cunaman ( voiced by Roger Black ) -- Connie is a lesbian female ranger who has a large body , immense strength , and a deep voice that is often mistaken for a male . In `` Gay Bomb '' , Connie admits she is a lesbian and it is revealed to the viewers that her strength is dubbed by her as `` lesbian strength '' . Connie is capable of lifting massive objects , such as trees , bears , and even a real bomb . She is obsessed with Ethel and was turned away by her Evangelical parents for being a homosexual . On a side note , when Connie gets excited , her vagina makes growling noises similar to that of a stomach , requiring her to talk it down like a wild animal . Malloy ( voiced by Daniel Tosh ) -- Malloy is the last surviving member of his species Ursus loquacious that Woody has taken in and spoiled after Steve accidentally ran over and shot his parents , telling him a tourist did it . Woody lets him play video games all day and eat junk food . Malloy is very crude , racist , sexist , has a superiority complex , and in some ways is a narcissist . He openly hates the rangers and in addition , he enjoys putting them down and messing with them on a daily basis , especially Steve .", "question_text": "who is the actor that played ethel in brickleberry", "title_text": "Brickleberry", "answer_spans": [[1559, 1584], [1587, 1620]], "answer_text": ["Kaitlin Olson in season 1", "Natasha Leggero in season 2 and 3"], "annotation": [{"context_entity_text": ".

Steopsunu is given for the Latin word filiaster and steopmoder for nouerca . Similar words recorded later in Old English include stepbairn , stepchild and stepfather .

( March 6 , 2017 ) 2017 North Korea test - fired a medium - range ballistic missile from its eastern port of Sinpo into the Sea of Japan ( April 4 , 2017 ) 2017 North Korea test - fired an unidentified land - based missile from the naval base in Sinpo but it exploded almost immediately after the takeoff ( April 15 , 2017 ) . 2017 North Korea test - fired an unidentified missile from Pukchang airfield ( April 28 , 2017 ) . Missile , believed to be a medium - range KN - 17 ballistic missile , falters and breaks apart minutes after liftoff . 2017 North Korea test - fired a Hwasong - 12 missile from a test site in the area of Kusong ( May 13 , 2017 ) . The missile , later revealed to be an intermediate range ballistic missile , traveled 30 minutes , reached an altitude of more than 2,111.5 km , and flew a horizontal distance of 789 km ( 489 miles ) , before falling into the Sea of Japan . Such a missile would have a range of at least 4,000 , reaching Guam , to 6,000 km . 2017 North Korea test - fired another Pukguksong - 2 medium - range ballistic missile from Pukchang airfield ( May 21 , 2017 ) , which traveled approximately 300 miles before falling into the Sea of Japan . The missile landed about 217 miles from North Korea 's east coast . 2017 North Korea fired a Short Range Ballistic Missile into the Sea of Japan ( May 29 , 2017 ) . It traveled 450 km . 2017 North Korea fired several missiles into the Sea of Japan ( June 8 , 2017 ) . They are believed to be anti-ship missiles . The South Korean military said the launches show the reclusive regime 's `` precise targeting capability . '' 2017 North Korea tested a new rocket engine that could possibly be fitted to an intercontinental ballistic missile ( June 23 , 2017 ) . 2017 North Korea tested its first intercontinental ballistic missile ( ICBM ) named Hwasong - 14 on July 4 . It launched from the Panghyon Aircraft Factory 8 km southeast of Panghyon Airport . It was aimed straight up at a lofted trajectory and reached more than 2,500 km into space . It landed 37 minutes later , more than 930 km from its launch site , into Japan 's exclusive economic zone . Aiming long , the missile would have traveled 7,000 - 8,000 km or more , reaching Alaska , Hawaii , and maybe Seattle . Its operational range would be farther , bringing a 500 kg payload to targets in most of the contiguous United States 9,700 km away . 2017 The 14th missile test carried out by North Korea in 2017 was another ICBM launched at 23 : 41 North Korea time ( 15 : 41 GMT ) from Chagang Province in the north of the country on July 28 , 2017 . Los Angeles , Denver , Chicago , Boston , and New York appear to be within range . The missile 's reentry vehicle ( RV ) was seen by people in Japan as it entered the atmosphere and landed near the northernmost Japanese island , Hokkaido . Analysis later revealed that the RV broke up on re-entry ; further testing would be required . The CIA made an assessment expecting adequate performance of the RV under the different stresses of a shallower trajectory towards the continental US . 2017 North Korea test fires three short range ballistic missiles from the Kangwon province on August 26 . Two travel approximately 250 kilometers in a northeastern direction and one explodes immediately after launch . 2017 On August 29 , 2017 , at 6 AM local time , North Korea launched a ballistic missile over Northern Japan . The missile 's short and low trajectory and its breakup into three pieces is consistent with the failure of a heavy post-boost vehicle . 2017 North Korea launched a ballistic missile on September 15 from Sunan airfield . It reached a height of 770 km and flew a distance of 3,700 km for 17 minutes over Hokkaido before landing in the Pacific .", "question_text": "when was the last time north korea fired a missile", "title_text": "List of North Korean missile tests", "answer_spans": [[5929, 5941]], "answer_text": ["September 15"], "annotation": [], "sentence_starts": [], "answer_type": "multi_sentence"}

( It should be noted that Earth Sciences is not actually a course offered in Alberta - parts of geological science are included in various other science courses in the province . This is one of a limited number of regional errors in this show . ) Amy is forced to choose between her love of healing troubled horses and living up to her father 's show jumping expectations . With no way to balance it all , Amy makes the hard decision to quit show jumping and sell Storm . This allows her to focus on her grades , chores , and work with horses . Meanwhile , Lou is searching for dude ranch horses and she is at odds with Tim over which horses to buy .

While checking a log on the trail to make sure it 's safe to jump , Mallory does n't notice Spartan leave .

Ashley takes Caleb to the polo club with her and shares her new pursuit of barrel racing ( which Kit is teaching her ) with her mother 's friends , much to Val 's chagrin . Ty asks Amy out on a date , but she already has plans with Caleb . Mallory tries to get rid of Jake , using lame excuses to avoid seeing him and ignoring his phone calls .

Ty and Kit are headed home in his truck , and they help the girls . The next morning , Ty takes the blame for the accident , as Ashley was drunk and Amy has only a Class 7 license ( learner 's permit ) , as she has n't taken the basic road test to earn her Class 5 Probationary license yet . Ashley goes home with her mother , who is angry over the $3700 in damages to Ashley 's BMW . 21 8 `` Summer 's End '' Don McBrearty Heather Conkie November 29 , 2008 ( 2008 - 11 - 29 ) 208 It 's the end of summer in Hudson , and the weather is sweltering .

One of the horses is down on the floor with a bad head wound , and Jack is forced to do the merciful thing , though Amy is desperate to prevent it . The other five horses are badly dehydrated and in rough shape , but able to wait until morning , when Scott can get to Heartland from Red Deer . Amy has a feeling that she knows one of the horses , and after cleaning his face , realizes that it is Ashley 's former jumper , Apollo . When Amy calls Ashley , she is distraught thinking that her mother sold Apollo to a meat truck . In fairness , Val thought that the horse dealer she sold to was reputable . Ashley smashes the windows of Val 's SUV with a golf club and runs away from home , despite Val 's threats to cut her off financially . Ashley spends much of the episode working and living at the dude ranch , and considering dropping out of high school . Ty is upset with his father for leaving him alone in Calgary , resulting in the men Brad owed money to tracking Ty down and beating him up several times . Father and son spend some time talking and they make peace , even talking about taking a trip to the Grand Canyon together . Amy , Ty , Caleb , and Mallory care for the horses , and this heavy episode is lightened by Mallory 's efforts to stay cool , standing in front of the open fridge and taking a cool bath with several bags of ice . There 's even a lighthearted water fight while the four of them are washing down the horses one evening . Amy and Ty are getting closer to where they left things before Ty went to Calgary . When the rain finally comes and cools off the heat , they go outside and kiss , but Ty breaks it off , worrying he is like his dad and saying he does n't want to hurt Amy . Once the horses are cared for , Lou deals with the logistics by making a deal with their owner ( a horse dealer ) to buy the five healthy horses for $2000 . However , Brad takes the money and leaves abruptly in the middle of the night , after receiving a call from the men that are still expecting his to return their money . Constable Rodriguez comes to the rescue when it looks like the horses will have to go back to the dealer , and the family keep the horses to use on trail rides for the dude ranch . 22 9 `` Showdown ! '' Sudz Sutherland Leila Basen and David Preston December 7 , 2008 ( 2008 - 12 - 07 ) 209 Amy and Soraya return to school , and Amy makes a bunch of schedules so that Caleb and Ty will do most of the work , and she wo n't have to fall behind in her studies this year . However , there have been some mysterious cattle rustlers roaming about stealing many ranchers ' cows and the ranchers are getting worried . Tim is one such rancher , and he hires both Caleb and Ty to watch his herd . This angers Amy , as she knows they wo n't have enough time to do most of the regular chores at the ranch as well . When she expresses this anger to Caleb , he kisses her and tells her that she thinks too much . The next day , Ty and Kit are having fun while working on schoolwork in the back of his truck , and they kiss . By this time , they had become close , and she had helped Ty apply to take online courses to complete his high - school diploma . Mallory discovered at the start of the episode that her parents had important news that could only be shared face - to - face . Her father has a gold record , and is going on tour to promote it . Since they ca n't be around to take care of her , Mallory is to be sent to Blessed Virgin Academy , an all - girls boarding school . There is a touching moment as she leaves the ranch . The tension continues to increase in this episode , as the ranchers become more and more concerned about their cattle . The police try to help track the rustlers , but they work swiftly , observing herds from a helicopter , then cutting fence lines and rounding up the cattle , driving them into a livestock trailer and escaping . Lou feels torn , as she has started seeing Mark Rodriguez , to whom her father is becoming increasingly hostile , feeling that the constable is inept at his job of preventing livestock theft . The episode reaches its climax when Ty and Caleb watch as the cattle rustlers turn up to steal Tim 's herd of cattle . Amy rides off in search of the ranch hands when she finds no work completed in the barn , and comes across the same scene , but one of the rustlers causes Spartan to rear , dropping Amy to the ground . Ty and Caleb come to help her , and she manages to escape , but the rustler has a gun and they stop advancing towards the scene of the crime . Jack drives up with Tim in tow , tipped off by Ashley , and try to stop the rustlers , but they are outnumbered . Amy sees this , and comes running towards them , calling , `` Dad ! '' The rustlers turn , guns in hand , and shoot towards her ; Tim takes a bullet to protect Amy . The episode ends on a cliffhanger , with no indication of where the bullet got Tim or whether he will survive , and the cattle rustlers drive off with his entire herd ( minus the two longhorns ) . 23 10 `` True Enough '' Sudz Sutherland Heather Conkie January 4 , 2009 ( 2009 - 01 - 04 ) 210 The episode prolongs the cliffhanger as long as possible , not referring to what happened to Tim , showing an influx of food from friends of the family ( which usually corresponds with a funeral ) and a conversation between Lou and Jack about Amy , saying that it 's good she went on a ride . She is even seen riding past the cemetery where her mom was buried in the first episode . Tim turns out to have been injured in his right shoulder , and he is wearing a sling . Tim becomes a source of tension in the household , constantly ringing a bell and expecting to be served . Amy is feeling guilty for being the cause of his bullet wound ( although indirectly ) , and she heals while caring for another horse . Amy 's teacher , Ruth Adams , is trying to sell her father 's old chestnut , Boxer . Amy and Ty try to help him settle in while they work on rehoming him , by bringing Hank Adams to visit his horse . While he is there , Ruth shows up , very upset that her father was brought to the ranch , revealing that Hank has Alzheimer 's . Despite being fuzzy about who his daughter is , Hank clearly remembers Boxer and even Jack . Jack eventually remembers that Hank was the lead guitarist for his wife , Lyndy , when she was a singer professionally . Jack had brought out an old record of hers to listen to , and they listen to it while talking with the Adams . Hank spontaneously picks up a guitar and starts playing the song in time with the record . In the end , Amy offers to keep Boxer so that Hank can visit him while he is able , and Ruth accepts this offer . While Tim is wearing out his welcome with Jack , Callie Phillips shows up and starts taking care of Tim . It seems they have been seeing each other since the cattle drive earlier in the season , and she stays at Big River whenever she is in town . This is quite a shock to the girls , who had no idea that Tim had a girlfriend . Amy is the least comfortable with it , and is fairly rude to Callie while she stays with them overnight . In the meantime , Lou is still seeing Mark , and enjoying it , even making him a mixed CD of police - related songs ( whether by theme or artists ' name ) . However , they were supposed to take a trip to the Banff Springs Hotel and have lunch there , but Mark says he is busy going to a provincial review meeting in Edmonton . This turns out to be a lie when Lou sees him kissing a blonde in Hudson , in his truck . He tries to explain that he did n't think they were exclusive , but Lou dumps him without a second thought . Ty is on a date with Kit , and Caleb tells Amy that Ty gave her up too easily . Caleb then shares a kiss with an enthusiastic Amy . Callie and Tim get in a fight , but get back together , and she takes him back to Big River , and finally out of Jack 's hair . 24 11 `` Starstruck ! '' Dean Bennett Leila Basen and David Preston January 11 , 2009 ( 2009 - 01 - 11 ) 211 Hollywood starlet and gossip - rag fodder Mindy Fanshaw arrives at Heartland under the pretext of honing her riding skills , which turn out to be non-existent . Mallory is found hiding in one of the dude ranch cabins , having been aided in her ' escape ' from the boarding school by Jake . Mallory collects items Mindy has used around Heartland , planning to sell them on eBay so she can repay Jake for the money he spent helping her . Mindy digs into the Ty / Amy / Caleb ' triangle ' , lying to all three about what the others had said and attempts to pit the three against each other . She attacks Amy in particular for being unable to choose between Ty and Caleb or express how she feels about either guy . When Mindy ropes Caleb into taking her on a trail ride , she insists on riding an ailing Pegasus , ignoring Amy 's warning that the horse should not be used . This results in a calculated photo - op for Mindy with paparazzi tipped off by her agent . The photographers get too close and spook Pegasus , dropping Mindy off his back , but causing stone bruises and a chipped bone for Pegasus . Lou eventually kicks Mindy out for behaving as a spoiled rich girl and disrupting the peace at Heartland , and she drives off into the sunset . She does leave Amy a parting gift , in the form of a very flashy , one of a kind belt , which was for sale at Maggie 's for $995 . Amy promptly gives this to Soraya , with whom she was fighting over Amy 's not sharing that Mindy was taking riding lessons at Heartland . 25 12 `` Divorce Horse '' Dean Bennett Heather Conkie January 18 , 2009 ( 2009 - 01 - 18 ) 212 Mackenzie Hutton returns to Heartland with a fianc\u00e9 , Ian , who she met after dumping her real estate agent boyfriend in New York . Mackenzie has changed quite a bit from her last visit to Heartland . She has given up the pretense of allergies to gluten , dairy , sugar , food that is not certified organic , and caffeine . She is also much more relaxed and happy with her easygoing husband - to - be in the picture . She has also taken a page from Lou 's book and quit her job to be her own boss , running a little art gallery in the Village . When Mackenzie arrives at Heartland , she is talking about a small wedding ( under 50 guests ) held outside near the dude ranch , with a BBQ cookout reception . Lisa ( with the best of intentions ) meddles with Lou 's plans for Mackenzie , since she knows the Huttons and their high - society lifestyle . Lisa and Mackenzie 's mom convince her that she would be happier with a sit - down reception dinner and a tent and roses and peonies for table settings , rather than what she and Ian had been hoping for . Lisa also meddles in Lou 's personal life , giving her email to a friend , who passed it on to another friend 's single son . Peter , the young man , emails Lou , but she has to decide if she wants to respond . In the meantime , Amy has been treating another horse for Lisa , an Andalusian beauty named Diva . Lisa claims the horse is cursed , calling her `` Diva girl , the divorce horse '' , as everyone who has owned the horse has become divorced . She is moody and temperamental , and Lisa asks Amy to figure her out , since Diva has been returned three times after being rehomed . With Ty and Caleb 's help , Amy determines that Diva just needs to be a horse , and hates to be kept in a stall . Unfortunately , this means that Lisa can not sell her as a show horse . She ultimately decides to give Diva to Mackenzie , who had taken a real shine to her , and would be able to keep her at her inlaws ' ranch in Montana . While Mackenzie and Ian had been fighting during the episode over whether to even get married after their plans were hijacked , they resolve their differences and remember how much they love one another . The episode ends with Mackenzie and Ian saying their vows in the company of the Heartland family , at sunset in front of the dude ranch cabins and overlooking the pond . 26 13 `` Seismic Shifts '' TW Peacocke Susin Nielsen February 8 , 2009 ( 2009 - 02 - 08 ) 213 Bedford Oil comes to Hudson and begins to conduct oil exploration on Jack 's property , using seismic testing and exploratory oil wells . Mallory tells Lou that there is little to be done , as the oil companies can do as they please . Feeling shocked by the injustice of it , Lou mobilizes the community against Bedford . She holds a town hall meeting where she invites local community members , their MLA , and a representative from Bedford Oil , who shows up and turns out to be PW ( Peter Walter ) Morris , the company owner . Tim shares a contrasting perspective with Lou privately , saying that he would be glad to have a well installed on his property , for the royalties he would be paid . Mallory is reading Wuthering Heights and becomes convinced that Amy and Ty are Catherine and Heathcliff , meant to be together but thwarted by circumstance . Amy is working on desensitizing a horse named Acorn to noise and struggles to make progress with the oil company blasting at the edge of Jack 's land . Ashley and Caleb become roommates , as Ashley leaves Briar Ridge again after fighting with her mother . Mallory discovers that the two fishermen staying at the dude ranch are actually working for the oil company , when she is cleaning their cabin and discovers their fishing gear left behind . Lou kicks them out , though they protest that they had paid for several days more . Lou continues to hold a grudge against Lisa and avoid her company , though she continues to instant message with the man that Lisa gave Lou 's email to . By the end of the episode , Lisa apologizes to Lou and they have an honest conversation , making up in the process . Lou meets PW in town twice , spilling coffee on his shirt both times . He seems somewhat interested in her , but she shuts him down . Lou agrees to meet `` Internet guy '' as Mallory has dubbed him , who turns out to be none other than PW . Neither one of them were able to make the connection , though , as both used their first names - Peter and Samantha . Lou lets practical considerations ( the fact that Peter is `` an oil guy '' ) get in the way of having a relationship ( or even a date ) with Peter . Nonetheless , they wind up kissing on the street in front of Maggie 's . Lou starts to leave , returns to kiss him again , and then says that their attraction can not go anywhere , ending the episode on a small cliffhanger . 27 14 `` Do or Die '' TW Peacocke Mark Haroun February 15 , 2009 ( 2009 - 02 - 15 ) 214 Ty 's former probation officer , Clint , brings two troubled kids to the ranch , hoping that they can learn something from Ty and the ranch where he sorted out his problems . The two kids , Tara and Badger , seem to be at the far end of the spectrum relative to Ty , starting off their stay by burning an Adirondack chair at the dude ranch and putting peanut butter in the muffin Clint was eating -- knowing he was allergic to peanuts . Tara is a goth , and Badger is a boy who never talks . They clash with most of the family , and especially Mallory . Tara teases her by calling her a cheerleader , Hilary Duff , and similar names that reflect her perception of Mallory as a peppy `` nice girl '' . Ty and Badger fight from the beginning , when he refuses to put out his cigarette and later lets all of the horses in the barn out . Tara follows Ty around a bit , making reference to them being alike , thinking she knows his experiences . Mallory eventually makes peace with Tara by sharing her own story about her parents leaving her at Heartland to go on the road . Tara responds dismissively , but Mallory says she should realize that other people have problems too . After this , Tara comes around . Mallory even persuades her to take a riding lesson , making a deal with Tara that Mallory will try out the goth look and attitude in exchange . Amy takes them back to the dude ranch so that she can watch them and there will be enough room for everyone , then sits outside with Ty by the fire as Mallory and Tara have a pillow fight . Ty confides that he did n't want the other foster kids at Heartland because he does n't want to be a poster boy for the rehabilitation program . Ty reveals that his mother remarried a man who was horrible to them both . He made a vow to pay him back for the pain he inflicted , and when he did , the neighbours called the cops . At this point , Ty met Clint , who was supposed to deal with the hopeless cases . Amy is happy that Ty finally shared his story , and tells him that she 's happy Clint brought him to Heartland . 28 15 `` Dark Horse '' Dean Bennett Leila Basen and David Preston March 1 , 2009 ( 2009 - 03 - 01 ) 215 When a county by - law threatens to separate elderly Mrs. Bell from her beloved pony Sugarfoot , Lou revives the Hudson Charity Derby to raise money for a legal defense fund . This reawakens an old rivalry between Tim and Jack , who were the reason the derby became defunct many years previously . Both dispute who won , because Tim won by going off - course during the race . Both sign up for this derby to settle their score . Kit drops off her horse Money ( short for You 're so Money ) , whom she thought was a chuckwagon horse , to Heartland for rehoming . Scott looks at the horse and determines that he has a tattoo , meaning he was a racehorse . Ty looks up Money 's records and discovers that he was a success when racing . Amy helps get Tim 's palomino horse in shape for the race , as Tim is still having difficulty riding due to his shoulder . Ty helps Jack train on their `` secret weapon '' because Jack 's horse , Paint , is too old to race in the derby . Tim and Jack are doing well in the race , until Tim falls off his horse and Jack stops to help him . Scott wins the race and Tim and Jack tie for second ( although Tim 's horse was ahead by a little bit , if you watch closely ) . Amy and Ty are recruited to be spotters at the halfway point , which does n't work out , as the walkie talkies that Amy and Lou communicate on are unable to connect properly over such a distance . Ty and Amy start play - fighting and almost kiss . Ashley 's mom offers to sponsor Caleb so he can join the professional rodeo circuit and leave Hudson . This episode features some comic relief between Jack and Tim - Tim offers Jack hay , and Jack thinks it will be free . They haggle over price , and Jack plans to take the hay . They disagree later , and he comes back to return the hay . In all , the hay is lifted onto and taken off of the bed of Jack 's truck no less than four times . 29 16 `` The Ties That Bind '' Dean Bennett Penny Gummerson March 8 , 2009 ( 2009 - 03 - 08 ) 216 The episode opens with Amy and Spartan out on a ride as dusk is falling . For no clear reason , Spartan is acting a bit uneasy . This part of the episode is filmed as if through the eyes of someone watching Amy and her horse , always with trees between the scene and the audience . When they return to the barn , Amy also seems uneasy , and decides not to let Ty turn Spartan out with the other horses overnight . That night , Amy tosses and turns , seeing the night her mom died in her dreams , while Wes breaks into the barn and escapes with Spartan . When Amy wakes up in the middle of the night and goes to check on him , she discovers that Spartan is gone . The family speaks to the police to track Spartan , but Ty and Amy also spend the next couple weeks checking horse auctions to see if Spartan turns up . They visit the Highwood Auction , and Ty buys a two - year - old bay gelding named Harley . Amy is angry that he spent the money he 'd been saving for a motorcycle on a horse , but he says that he 's almost a motorcycle , due to the name . Amy starts to storm out , but Ty stops her when he sees Spartan turn up . Spartan is there and Wes buys him `` legally '' . Amy tries to prove that Spartan is her horse , but she does n't possess a bill of sale , and current registration papers do n't prove it without one . Wes is unable to leave with Spartan right away because Ty slashed his tires to ensure he could n't leave before they talked to the brand inspector . Ty chases down Wes later , hoping to buy Spartan back , but Wes refuses to sell him for any price . Amy later plans to return and steal Spartan from the auction house , and Ty tries to talk her out of it , saying it 's a felony . ( This is actually untrue in Alberta , as indictable offences are applied in Canada . This is one of a limited number of regional errors in this show . ) In the end , Ty reluctantly agrees to help her that evening . Ty gets caught and taken to jail , where Jack bails him out , but he may still be convicted . Jack and Tim track down Wes and force him to sign a bill of sale , returning Spartan and preventing similar problems for Amy in the future . Jack also talks to Constable Rodriguez , who promises to destroy the file on Ty 's theft attempt . Ty instead has to do 200 hours of community service , and Amy is grounded until further notice . Mallory 's horse , Copper , is scared of her because of her `` goth '' look , so she returns to her normal style by the end of the episode . Lou is apprehensive of revealing to her family that she is dating an oil guy , and goes to extreme measures to avoid them seeing her with Peter . Caleb gets his rodeo card , and Val offers him a sponsorship to go on the road and stay away from Ashley . Caleb debates whether to take it , and talks to both Ty and Kit about it . In the end , he decides to go , and does so at the end of the episode . 30 17 `` Full Circle '' Don McBrearty Penny Gummerson March 15 , 2009 ( 2009 - 03 - 15 ) 217 Spartan refuses to jump for Amy and she is suffering from the trauma of having him stolen , so Amy takes him to Marion 's Aboriginal Canadian friend Victor Whitetail who helps people connect with their horses . He helps Amy process her feelings and heal , using traditional Aboriginal methods . Victor was more than friends with Marion after Tim left . Peter books the entire dude ranch in order to spend time with Lou , who continues to keep him a secret from her family . Peter is forced to tell Lou he has an ex-wife when he has to take care of their dog , Max . Lou promises to let him meet her family , now that she knows more about his . Ty breaks Harley while Amy stays at Victor 's , but gets into a fight with Kit when she tries to show him her methods . Later , Ty breaks up with Kit , realizing he has feelings for Amy ; when she returns , he tells her he ca n't continue being only friends . Ashley mopes around because Caleb has n't spoken to her since leaving for the rodeo circuit . 31 18 `` Step By Step '' Don McBrearty Heather Conkie March 22 , 2009 ( 2009 - 03 - 22 ) 218 Ty tells Jack and Amy that this winter is very hard on the mustangs in the mountains , and Amy wants to go feed them . Jack says it will make them dependent on people . At dinner , Mallory reveals that Ty has earned his high school diploma and later tells Amy that he 's at a crossroads , and asks if Amy has any plans . She replies that she 's working on it . Her method is revealed when we see Amy talking about sneaking up to the fishing cabin with Ty to feed the horses , which will also give them a great opportunity to talk . Jack comes into the barn to tell them that it 's now necessary to feed the horses , and the three of them can go up that weekend . However , Lou has weekend plans and Mallory and Jake have nowhere to stay , so Jack winds up looking after them . This leaves Amy and Ty free to follow through with their plans , in the open . When they arrive , Amy and Ty spread out the hay for the horses , and Ty collapses after thinking he sees Ghost . ( This is the second time that Ghost shows up when Ty is in danger . ) Ty develops a high fever , but no one else can reach the fishing cabin because the highway is closed . Lou was heading to a spa with Peter along one of the mountain highways , but they were forced to turn back due to the closures . Lou made an attempt to tell Jack about Peter , but Mallory and Jake spilled something in the other room , and Jack took them to Maggie 's . When they return , Lou introduces Peter to Jack , who is incredibly unhappy that Lou is dating an oil guy , even calling him the enemy . However , after Amy contacts Jack via the cabin 's shortwave radio , Peter organizes snowplows to clear the highway in the morning , and Jack grudgingly accepts him . Amy cares for Ty overnight , and his fever eventually breaks . It turns out that Ghost really was there , not a hallucination of Ty 's brought on by illness . Upon seeing Ghost outside , the pair go out to greet him , and Amy begins to talk about what Ty said . She agrees they ca n't just be friends , admitting that she loves him . Ty finally tells Amy his feelings for her . Meanwhile , Val gets her test results back , and they are negative . Val tells Ashley that she sponsored Caleb , which causes Ashley to become upset with her mom and Caleb . When he returns to his trailer , Ashley kicks him out . Later , Val is driving along , and pulls over to answer her phone and discover that she needs further tests . Jack gives Tim a loan , since Tim was thinking of selling land to Val to be able to afford to continue after losing his herd of cattle , which would turn Val into Jack 's neighbour on both sides . Once they return to Heartland , Amy and Ty get cozy on the couch . He makes Amy say she loves him again , and they kiss .", "question_text": "when do ty and amy get together season 2", "title_text": "List of Heartland episodes", "answer_spans": [[32937, 32949]], "answer_text": ["Step By Step"], "annotation": [], "sentence_starts": [], "answer_type": "multi_sentence"}

Almack 's , the most exclusive club in London , permitted the waltz though the entry in the Oxford English Dictionary shows that it was considered `` riotous and indecent '' as late as 1825 . Ann Bronte in ' The Tenant of Wildfell Hall ' has a scene set in 1827 where the local vicar Reverend Milward tolerates quadrilles and country dances but intervenes decisively when a waltz is called for , declaring `` No , no , I do n't allow that !

While exploring the ruins , Klaus finds a broken spyglass with an insignia of an eye embedded on the front . Shortly afterwards , they are sent to live with their distant relative Count Olaf , a cruel and vain amateur actor , who forces them into servitude . One night , the siblings prepare puttanesca for Olaf 's theatre troupe only for him to demand roast beef upon arriving home . The children state that they were never asked to prepare roast beef , angering Olaf and prompting him to slap Klaus across the face when he protests about the sleeping arrangements . Meanwhile , a mother and father are held against their will by a mysterious captor . `` The Bad Beginning : Part Two '' Barry Sonnenfeld Daniel Handler January 13 , 2017 ( 2017 - 01 - 13 ) The Baudelaires attempt to convince Mr. Poe of Olaf 's actions , only to be sent away when Poe dismisses their claims . When Olaf gives Violet the starring role in his latest theatrical production , which ends with the two main characters being married , the siblings realize that Olaf intends to acquire their fortune by marrying Violet for real . Klaus confronts Olaf , who threatens to kill Sunny if Violet does n't follow through with his plans . At the very last minute , however , Violet signs the marriage certificate with her left hand , invalidating the proceedings due to the fact that she is right - handed . Mr. Poe 's mysterious secretary Jacquelyn reveals they were intended to be put in the care of their distant relative Montgomery Montgomery . Meanwhile , Jacquelyn 's ally Gustav is mysteriously drowned , after being hit by a poisoned dart . `` The Reptile Room : Part One '' Mark Palansky Daniel Handler January 13 , 2017 ( 2017 - 01 - 13 ) The Baudelaires are sent to live with their herpetologist uncle Montgomery Montgomery , who has recently come across a reptile he calls the Incredibly Deadly Viper .

Olaf poses as Montgomery 's new assistant Stephano and attempts to kidnap the Baudelaires , but Monty assures the Baudelaires that he recognizes Stephano as a threat . The four arrive at a movie theatre , where Monty deciphers a code sent for him through the subtitles of the film , using a spyglass identical to Klaus ' . The message instructs him to bring the children to Peru . He fires Stephano shortly afterwards , believing him to be a spy sent to steal his research . `` The Reptile Room : Part Two '' Mark Palansky Emily Fox January 13 , 2017 ( 2017 - 01 - 13 ) Immediately after dismissing `` Stephano , '' Montgomery notices that the door to his Reptile Room is ajar and investigates , only to be attacked by an unseen figure . The next day , the Baudelaires discover Olaf standing next to Montgomery 's corpse . Olaf threatens to kill Sunny unless the siblings accompany him to Peru , but is prevented from carrying out his plan when Mr. Poe accidentally crashes into their car when they are trying to leave . Olaf 's theatre troupe then arrives disguised as police and nurses , and claim Monty was killed by the Incredibly Deadly Viper , despite Monty 's claim of it being completely harmless . While searching for proof of the snake 's innocence , Klaus discovers a statue in Monty 's hedge maze , and a photograph of Monty , both of them carrying spyglasses identical to Klaus ' . Violet proves Olaf to be the murderer ; however , he escapes via the hedge maze with Klaus ' spyglass . While pursuing him , the Baudelaires meet Jacquelyn , who is posing as a statue .

She refuses to answer questions about their parents , so the siblings pursue answers themselves around her house , and discover their parents were members of a secret organization , with spyglasses being used as useful devices . They are also shocked to find out that Josephine was once fierce and formidable , and developed her phobias after the death of her husband . Olaf , who has followed the Baudelaires , disguises himself as a sailor named Captain Sham before pretending to fall in love with Josephine . Despite the siblings ' warnings , Josephine accepts his invitation to take her out for a fried egg sandwich . Later that night , the siblings discover that Josephine has jumped out the library 's bay window and left a note informing them that `` Captain Sham '' is their new guardian . 6 6 `` The Wide Window : Part Two '' Barry Sonnenfeld Daniel Handler January 13 , 2017 ( 2017 - 01 - 13 ) As Mr. Poe prepares to hand the Baudelaires over to `` Captain Sham , '' the siblings discover the note has several grammatical errors , something Josephine would never do since she was obsessed with proper grammar . Mr. Poe takes the children to a restaurant and prepares to complete the transfer , but allows the siblings to leave after Larry , a waiter secretly a member of their parents ' organization , triggers their allergy to peppermint . After returning to the house , the siblings decipher Josephine 's suicide note and discover she is still alive moments before a hurricane sends the house teetering over the cliff . Escaping with a photograph of their parents standing in front of a lumber mill , the siblings find Josephine at a nearby cave , only to be confronted by Olaf , who abandons Josephine to be eaten alive by the leeches that inhabit Lake Lachrymose .

Will Poulter was previously cast in the role but was forced to drop out due to scheduling conflicts , with Poulter stating , `` I was when Mr. Fukunaga was directing , but the circumstances at New Line are such that a new director 's attached now . '' Poulter continued , `` I think , with all due respect to him of course , I was selected by Cary and subscribed to Cary 's vision for the movie , and so I have n't had a chance to connect with that ( new ) director . '' Mark Rylance , Ben Mendelsohn , Kirk Acevedo , Richard Armitage , Hugo Weaving , and Tilda Swinton were considered for the role , with Mendelsohn passing on the project , as New Line wanted him to take a sizable pay cut . On June 3 , 2016 , The Independent officially reported , after final negotiations took place , that Muschietti had chosen actor Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd to portray the character . On portraying Pennywise , Skarsg\u00e5rd stated , `` It 's such an extreme character . Inhumane , It 's beyond even a sociopath because he 's not even human . He 's not even a clown . I 'm playing just one of the beings It creates . '' Skarsg\u00e5rd described the character further , saying , `` It truly enjoys the shape of the clown Pennywise , and enjoys the game and the hunt . '' He also commented , `` What 's funny to this evil entity might not be funny to everyone else . But he thinks it 's funny . '' On Pennywise 's design , Skarsg\u00e5rd stated , `` It 's important that we do something fresh and original for this one . It 's purposely not going toward that weird , greasy look . '' He also commented on being compared to Tim Curry , stating that , `` ( Curry ) 's performance was truly great , but it 's important for me to do something different because of that . I 'll never be able to make a Tim Curry performance as good as Tim Curry . '' Skarsg\u00e5rd also elaborated on his age , stating , `` There 's a childishness to the character , because he 's so closely linked to the kids . The clown is the manifestation of children 's imaginations , so there 's something child - like about that . '' Producer Dan Lin spoke of Skarsg\u00e5rd 's physical attributes : `` His build is really interesting . He 's really tall and lanky , and feels a little clown like in his movement . When he came in -- we had a lot of different actors read , and when he came in he had a different spin on the character that got us really excited . '' Lin concluded by contrasting the character with that of Heath Ledger 's Joker , `` You 've had ( Ledger ) doing almost a clown joker , you 've seen obviously Tim Curry as a clown . We wanted someone who created a Pennywise character that would stand on its own and Bill came in and created this character that frankly freaked us out . '' Muschietti spoke of Skarsg\u00e5rd 's Pennywise as one not to lurk in the shadows , to which he remarked , `` Pennywise shows up , he 's front and center , and he does his show . He has an act ... So it 's weird all the time , and every little thing implies a further threat . '' Muschietti also spoke of wanting to make the sense of dread that grows in Derry part of the dread of Pennywise , to which he stated , `` He 's not just a character that can shape - shift , his influence is all around . The anticipation of him is almost scarier than the actual Pennywise scares . '' On selecting Skarsg\u00e5rd to portray Pennywise , Muschietti wanted to stay true to the essence of the character , and Skarsg\u00e5rd caught his attention , `` The character has a childish and sweet demeanor , but there 's something very off about him . Bill has that balance in him . He can be sweet and cute , but he can be pretty disturbing . '' Wyatt Oleff as Stanley `` Stan '' Uris : A Jewish mysophobe who is the son of a rabbi . He is studying for his bar mitzvah but is n't interested in religion , which is upsetting to his father . On the character of Uris , Muschietti spoke of him knowing a situation of despair , `` Long story short , there 's all sorts of difficult situations , and we had the chance to tell them in a movie that faces directly those conflicts ... the families of the young actors were very open - minded , so we could tell them about subjects that are normally very touchy . '' Jeremy Ray Taylor as Benjamin `` Ben '' Hanscom : Hanscom is the new kid at school and consequently does not have any friends . He likes reading and researching so he spends a lot of time in the library . He is also very overweight , which earns his place in the Losers ' Club , but like all of the Losers , there are underlying facets that define him far more than superficial appearances . On the character of Hanscom , Muschietti spoke of him knowing a situation of despair , `` ... Ben is bullied at school . '' Sophia Lillis as Beverly `` Bev '' Marsh : The only female member of the Losers ' Club , she is bullied at school , particularly concerning false rumors that she is promiscuous . Her home life is also dismal , as her violent father is sexually abusive to her . On the character of Marsh , Muschietti spoke of her knowing a situation of despair , `` Beverly 's case is of course the worst , because it 's about sexual abuse on a minor . '' In an interview with Rolling Stone , Lillis spoke of Muschietti not wanting her and her co-stars to spend too much time with Skarsg\u00e5rd : `` We actually were n't allowed to see him until our scenes , because we wanted the horror to be real . '' On Skarsg\u00e5rd 's appearance as Pennywise , she recalled , `` Everyone had different reactions , but all of us were like , ' Wow , what did we get ourselves into ? ' One look at him , and ... you know , he 's a really scary clown that wants to kill us . I was a little bit shocked . '' On her connection with her fellow co-stars , she noted that the closeness of the friendships formed allowed Lillis to connect with her own character : `` I relate to Beverly -- the way she deals with her emotions , and the way she was around the Losers . I felt that way around the actual actors . '' Finn Wolfhard as Richard `` Richie '' Tozier : The bespectacled best friend of Bill Denbrough , whose loud mouth and foul language often get him into trouble . Wolfhard , famous as Mike Wheeler in Stranger Things , shared the first image of the Losers Club on his Instagram account , with the photo captioned as `` The Losers Club take Toronto '' , showing the cast of actors who would play the protagonists . Wolfhard was the only actor cast in both this and Fukunaga 's version . On the character of Tozier , Muschietti spoke of him knowing a situation of despair , `` We do n't know much about Richie 's personality , because he 's the big mouth of the group . But we suppose he 's also neglected at home , and he 's the clown of the band because he needs attention . '' Jack Dylan Grazer as Edward `` Eddie '' Kaspbrak : Kaspbrak is the epitome of the hypochondriac , overly exaggerated by the immense amount of objects in his medicine cabinet ; a sickly boy who only feels truly well when he is with his friends .

Rejewski achieved this result without knowledge of the wiring of the machine , so the result did not allow the Poles to decrypt actual messages . The French had a spy with access to German cipher materials that included the daily keys used in September and October 1932 . Those keys included the plugboard settings . The French gave the material to the Poles , and Rejewski used some of that material and the message traffic in September and October to solve for the unknown rotor wiring . Consequently , the Poles were able to build their own Enigma machines , which were called Enigma doubles . Rejewski was aided by cryptanalysts Jerzy R\u00f3\u017cycki and Henryk Zygalski , both of whom had been recruited with Rejewski from Pozna\u0144 University . The Polish Cipher Bureau developed techniques to defeat the plugboard and find all components of the daily key , which enabled the Cipher Bureau to read the German 's Enigma messages . Over time , the German cryptographic procedures improved , and the Cipher Bureau developed techniques and designed mechanical devices to continue breaking the Enigma traffic . As part of that effort , the Poles exploited quirks of the rotors , compiled catalogs , built a cyclometer to help make a catalog with 100,000 entries , made Zygalski sheets and built the electro - mechanical cryptologic bomb to search for rotor settings . In 1938 , the Germans added complexity to the Enigma machines that finally became too expensive for the Poles to counter .

By 1978 , the Department of Defense had implemented basic smoking regulations , including the designation of smoking and nonsmoking areas . In 1985 , the Department of Defense conducted a study that revealed that smoking rates of military personnel ( 47 % ) were significantly higher than that of US civilians ( 30 % ) and concluded that smoking had a negative effect on troop readiness . The report also cited an estimated tobacco - related healthcare costs as high as $209.9 million , and recommended potential methods to curb smoking in the military , including the elimination of tobacco products from stores , raising tobacco prices to civilian levels , and the implementation of an educational program to discourage smoking . In 1986 , the DoD Directive 1010.10 was issued by Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger , who announced , `` an intense anti-smoking campaign ... at all levels of all Services . '' It established a policy on smoking and other health risk behaviors such as alcohol consumption . The policy banned the use of tobacco during basic training , increased the number of designated nonsmoking areas , and prohibited health care providers from smoking on duty . The goal of the policy was to reduce all tobacco use rates to below that of civilians , and to reduce personnel and active duty rates from 52 % to 25 % by 1990 . In 1992 , the DeCA Directive 40 - 13 policy prohibited commissaries and exchanges from participating with promotions by tobacco manufacturers directed specifically at military personnel , and required commissaries to stock cigarettes in the back . In 1993 , the USS Theodore Roosevelt ( CVN - 71 ) became the first smoke - free Navy ship . By 1994 , the Department of Defense had implemented Directive 1010.15 which banned smoking in workplaces , designated outdoor smoking areas , and created the precursor of an education program that sought to distribute information to new personnel on the health effects of smoking and to encourage smokers to quit . Executive Order 13508 in 1997 banned smoking in all government - owned , rented , or leased interior spaces , but the Department of Defense approved a three - year phase - in period for their facilities and eventually implemented the ban on December 7 , 2002 . Despite these attempts , by 1988 , the smoking rate had only decreased to 42 % and far exceeded the rate of civilians .

The story begins on a cold , windy day in fictional Dickson County ( representing Dickinson County , Iowa ) with Martha Hale being abruptly called to ride to a crime scene . In the buggy is Lewis Hale , her husband , Sheriff Peters , the county sheriff , and Mrs. Peters , the sheriff 's wife . She rushes out to join them in the buggy , and the group sets off . They arrive at the crime scene : the Wrights ' lonesome - looking house . Immediately Mrs. Hale exhibits a feeling of guilt for not visiting her friend Minnie Foster since she married and became Mrs. Wright ( the dead man 's wife ) twenty years prior . Once the whole group is safely inside the house , Mr. Hale is asked to describe to the county attorney what he had seen and experienced the day prior . Despite the serious circumstances , he delivers his story in a long - winded and poorly thought - out manner , tendencies he struggles to avoid throughout . The story begins with Mr. Hale venturing to Mr. Wright 's house to convince Wright to get a telephone . Upon entering the house , he finds Mrs. Wright in a delirious state and comes to learn that Mr. Wright has allegedly been strangled . The women 's curious nature and very peculiar attention to minute details allows them to find evidence of Mrs. Wright 's guilt and of her provocations and motives . Meanwhile , the men are unable to procure any evidence . The women find the one usable piece of evidence : the dead bird in the box . It 's stated that Minnie used to love to sing and her husband took that away from her . But now finding her bird is dead , with a broken neck ( with the implication that the husband killed it ) it is evident Mrs. Wright killed her husband . Mrs. Hale and Mrs. Peters use their knowledge and experience as two `` midwestern rural women '' to understand Mrs. Wright 's suffering when the only living thing around her has died . The women find justification in Mrs. Wright 's actions and go about hiding what they find from the men . In the end , their obstruction of evidence will seemingly prevent a conviction .

{"example_id": 1928623067282653280, "paragraph_text": "Ladybird Hill -- The Hills ' thirteen - year - old purebred Georgia Bloodhound named after the First Lady of the United States Lady Bird Johnson . It 's said that her mother helped track down James Earl Ray , as revealed by Hank in episode 7 of season 1 titled `` Westie Side Story '' . Her companionship temporarily relieved Hank 's stress ( and narrow urethra ) , allowing him to impregnate Peggy . Later on in the series Ladybird would become deaf and despite much effort on Hank 's part , would never bear puppies because of her narrow uterus . Col. Cotton Lyndal Hill ( voiced by Toby Huss ) -- Hank 's cantankerous father , with a hair - trigger temper . Despite his many shortcomings , he occasionally showed a softer side , for example in the episode `` Cotton 's Plot '' where he helped Peggy learn to walk again after her parachuting accident . His shins were blown off in World War II by a `` Japan man 's machine gun '' and his feet were reattached to his knees , resulting in a short height and stilted gait . Despite his disability , he eventually reached the rank of colonel in the state militia . After Cotton and his first wife Tillie , Hank 's mother , divorced , he married a much younger , soft - spoken , busty blonde candy striper named Didi who gave birth to his youngest son `` G.H. '' ( `` Good Hank '' ) . He was immensely proud of his military service . Though his claim of fighting `` nazzies '' ( Nazis ) was proven false and his claim of killing `` fitty ( fifty ) men '' was dubious , his participation in several of the bloodiest battles in the Pacific Theater was confirmed and his uniform was shown to be decorated with the Medal of Honor and the Purple Heart . Cotton himself died in episode # 1218 , `` Death Picks Cotton '' , after suffering severe burns and an allergic reaction to shrimp during a flashback at a Japanese restaurant . Didi Hill ( voiced by Ashley Gardner ) -- Didi is Cotton 's second wife and a candy striper after she retired from being an exotic dancer . She has breast implants and suffers from postpartum depression following the birth of Cotton 's third son `` G.H. '' She is generally depicted as docile and unintelligent , although she is a certified optometry assistant . She was absent at the time of Cotton 's death and was only seen once more , where she says she is engaged and will remarry . Didi was a classmate of Hank 's in Kindergarten ( indicating they are the same age ) . Good Hank Jeffrey `` G.H. '' Hill -- G.H. is Cotton 's and Didi 's infant son , and the younger of Hank 's two half - brothers . G.H. is an abbreviation for `` Good Hank , '' implying that the original Hank was unsatisfactory to his father . Cotton treats G.H. much better than Hank presumably because Cotton sees him as being his second chance of being a better father than he was for Hank . G.H. was key at a time when Hank had to convince Cotton not to end his life as well as to permit Hank to give his father money for the baby 's sake ( and as payback for the years Cotton raised him ) . G.H. was absent at the time of his father 's death , and is not seen throughout the rest of the series , although it is presumed he is living with his mother and stepfather . Matilda `` Tillie '' Mae Hill Garrison ( voiced by Tammy Wynette in 1997 -- 1998 , Beth Grant in 1999 , and K Callan in 2000 -- 2009 ) -- Tillie is Cotton 's first wife and Hank 's mother . She divorced Cotton after suffering years of verbal abuse . Tillie is a kind woman who collects miniatures because they made her happy during Cotton 's abuse . Hank is often over-protective of her , fearing she is too old and fragile to go out and do things on her own . Tillie lives in Arizona with her husband Chuck , having formerly lived with her Jewish boyfriend Gary ( voiced by Carl Reiner ) . Tillie 's legal name varies during the series . She is listed as `` Tillie '' on Hank 's birth certificate , but is addressed as Matilda by the clergyman during her wedding to Chuck . Elroy `` Lucky '' Kleinschmidt ( voiced by Tom Petty ) -- Lucky is Luanne 's itinerant , but generally benign redneck husband , and is the father of Luanne 's child . It is often hard for Lucky to hold down a job ( he has no credit or Social Security number ) . He lives on the remainder of the $53,000 `` settlement monies '' he received after `` slipping on pee - pee at the Costco '' having had a portion of his spine fused . He was nicknamed `` Lucky '' after the settlement windfall . After he spent a majority of his money customizing his truck , his finances dwindled down to nine thousand dollars but regained another $53,000 when an ambulance chasing lawyer paid off Lucky to avoid a lawsuit . Peggy tried very hard to break him and Luanne apart , but after Luanne 's pregnancy was revealed , she and Hank reconciled the two , giving them a shotgun wedding at Lucky 's request . He is also one of the guitarists for John Redcorn 's band `` Big Mountain Fudgecake '' . Although dimwitted in some aspects , Lucky has learned some facets such as basic math through life experience as opposed to formal education , and was astute enough to deduce that his father - in - law spent time in jail whereas Luanne believed the story that he works on an oil rig . He yearned to receive his GED but only to prove he was good enough to marry Luanne . Gracie Margaret Kleinschmidt -- Daughter of Lucky and Luanne . She was born in the season 13 episode `` Lucky See , Monkey Do '' . Luanne originally wanted to name her Lasagna ( stating that lasagna was their favorite food ) while under the influence of hospital analgesics , but choosing a more conventional name after she had recovered . Myrna Kleinschmidt ( voiced by Paget Brewster ) -- Myrna is Lucky 's sister , Luanne 's sister - in - law , Gracie 's aunt , and the main antagonist in `` Lucky See , Monkey Do '' . She is an intelligent , modern mother who only appears in the episode `` Lucky See , Monkey Do '' . She has two children , one son and one daughter ( Gracie 's paternal first cousins ) and raises them in strict accordance with contemporary parenting practices , something which leads her into a rivalry with Peggy , whose parenting skills are from older schools of thought , over how to assist Luanne as her pregnancy due date approaches . When Luanne goes into labor , Myrna commandeers the situation and insists that Luanne have a natural , drug - free water birth , but under Hank 's encouragement to think for themselves about how to raise their child , Luanne and Lucky opt for a hospital birth instead . Leanne Platter ( voiced by Pamela Adlon ) -- Leanne , Luanne 's violent alcoholic mother , was imprisoned for `` second - degree assaulting '' her husband in the back with a fork . Though she is often mentioned during the course of the series , she appears only in the episode `` Leanne 's Saga , '' visiting Luanne in Arlen after her release from prison and briefly being courted by Bill Dauterive . Hoyt Platter ( voiced by Johnny Knoxville ) -- Hoyt is Luanne 's father , Peggy 's twin brother and Leanne 's ex-husband . Despite Luanne 's beliefs , he never worked on an oil rig , but was in jail for most of Luanne 's life , with the oil rig story acting as a cover so Luanne would n't know her father was a convict . He appears in only one episode : `` Life : A Loser 's Manual '' . After being released from jail , Hoyt commits a robbery and tricks Lucky into taking the blame , but he eventually confesses and is sentenced to life in prison under a three - strikes law . The episode `` Leanne 's Saga '' reveals that Hoyt was planning on marrying a pharmacist girl before Leanne , then working as a stripper , entertained at his bachelor party . Maddy Platter ( voiced by Joanna Gleason ) -- Maddy Platter is Peggy 's and Hoyt 's mother and Bobby 's and Luanne 's grandmother . Mother Platter lives in Montana with her son Hoyt . She is an old - fashioned , tough - as - nails rancher type and loathes Peggy for deserting the family ranch and not marrying a local neighbor boy . Strangely , earlier episode flashbacks feature a totally different `` Peggy 's mother '' character , who is essentially an older version of Peggy - it is not made clear if one is her real mother and one is her stepmother , or if the `` Maddy '' mother character retconned the older version completely . Doc Platter -- Doc is Peggy 's father . He makes only a single major appearance when Peggy , Bobby and Hank visit the family ranch . He seems to be going somewhat senile and preachy , which Hank misinterprets as old - fashion Western - style wisdom . Junichiro ( voiced by David Carradine ) -- Junichiro is Hank 's elder half - Japanese half - brother who has lived in Japan all his life . Hank and Junichiro have the same father , due to Cotton 's affair with a Japanese nurse during his war days , and share many similarities in appearance and mannerisms ( this in spite of the fact that Hank actually shares more of his mother 's features ) ; one of these is that when he is shocked , like Hank , he yells `` BWAH ! '' Like Hank , Junichiro also has a narrow urethra and is an assistant manager at the company for which he works , making robots and robot accessories . Dusty Hill ( Himself ) -- The bassist / vocalist for the band ZZ Top and Hank 's cousin .
