The NBA 's Minneapolis Lakers had relocated to Los Angeles in 1960 due to poor attendance which was believed to have been caused in part by the reluctance of fans in St. Paul to support the team . Griffith was determined not to alienate fans in either city by naming the team after one city or the other , so his desire was to name the team the `` Twin Cities Twins '' , however MLB objected . Griffith therefore named the team the Minnesota Twins . However , the team was allowed to keep its original `` TC '' ( for Twin Cities ) insignia for its caps . The team 's logo shows two men , one in a Minneapolis Millers uniform and one in a St. Paul Saints uniform , shaking hands across the Mississippi River within an outline of the state of Minnesota . The `` TC '' remained on the Twins ' caps until 1987 , when they adopted new uniforms . By this time , the team felt it was established enough to put an `` M '' on its cap without having St. Paul fans think it stood for Minneapolis . The `` TC '' logo was moved to a sleeve on the jerseys , and occasionally appeared as an alternate cap design . Both the `` TC '' and `` Minnie & Paul '' logos remain the team 's primary insignia .

During the Constitutional Convention , a proposal was made for the Supreme Court to be the only federal court , having both original jurisdiction and appellate jurisdiction . This proposal was rejected in favor of the provision that exists today . Under this provision , the Congress may create inferior ( i.e. , lower ) courts under both Article III , Section 1 , and Article I , Section 8 . The Article III courts , which are also known as `` constitutional courts '' , were first created by the Judiciary Act of 1789 . Article I courts , which are also known as `` legislative courts '' , consist of regulatory agencies , such as the United States Tax Court . Article III courts are the only ones with judicial power , and so decisions of regulatory agencies remain subject to review by Article III courts . However , cases not requiring `` judicial determination '' may come before Article I courts . In the case of Murray 's Lessee v. Hoboken Land & Improvement Co. 59 U.S. 272 ( 1855 ) , the Supreme Court ruled that cases involving `` a suit at the common law , or in equity , or admiralty '' inherently involve judicial determination and must come before Article III courts . Other cases , such as bankruptcy cases , have been held not to involve judicial determination , and may therefore go before Article I courts . Similarly , several courts in the District of Columbia , which is under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Congress , are Article I courts rather than Article III courts . This article was expressly extended to the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico by the U.S. Congress through Federal Law 89 - 571 , 80 Stat. 764 , signed by President Lyndon B.
