This is a medical emergency as it results from rapid destruction of the donor red blood cells by host antibodies ( IgG , IgM ) . It is usually related to ABO blood group incompatibility - the most severe of which often involves group A red cells being given to a patient with group O type blood . Properdin then binds to complement C3 in the donor blood , facilitating the reaction through the alternate pathway cascade . The donor cells also become coated with IgG and are subsequently removed by macrophages in the reticuloendothelial system ( RES ) . Jaundice and disseminated intravascular coagulation ( DIC ) may also occur . The most common cause is clerical error ( i.e. the wrong unit of blood being given to the patient ) .",

    "paragraph_text": "The earliest predecessors of the eye were photoreceptor proteins that sense light , found even in unicellular organisms , called `` eyespots '' . Eyespots can only sense ambient brightness : they can distinguish light from dark , sufficient for photoperiodism and daily synchronization of circadian rhythms . They are insufficient for vision , as they can not distinguish shapes or determine the direction light is coming from . Eyespots are found in nearly all major animal groups , and are common among unicellular organisms , including euglena . The euglena 's eyespot , called a stigma , is located at its anterior end . It is a small splotch of red pigment which shades a collection of light sensitive crystals . Together with the leading flagellum , the eyespot allows the organism to move in response to light , often toward the light to assist in photosynthesis , and to predict day and night , the primary function of circadian rhythms . Visual pigments are located in the brains of more complex organisms , and are thought to have a role in synchronising spawning with lunar cycles . By detecting the subtle changes in night - time illumination , organisms could synchronise the release of sperm and eggs to maximise the probability of fertilisation .",

In the shorts Jerry would often try to get Tom in trouble with Spike making him a shoo - in for a beating from the bulldog . Spike has a few weaknesses that Tom tries to capitalize upon : his possessiveness about his bone and his ticklishness . He made his first appearance in the 1942 Tom and Jerry cartoon Dog Trouble , and his first speaking role was in 1944 's The Bodyguard , where he was voiced by Billy Bletcher up until 1949 , from which point he was voiced by Daws Butler . Unlike his father Spike , Tyke does not speak . He only communicates by yapping , whimpering , growling , facial expressions and wagging his tail . In Tom and Jerry Kids , Tyke does have a speaking role in the program and is the first time that viewers were able to hear Tyke speak . Spike is very protective towards his son and gets very angry at Tom if Tyke is bothered or harmed . Although Tyke has spoken in Tom and Jerry Kids , he has laughed in one Tom and Jerry short . After Daws Butler , Maurice LaMarche , Frank Welker , John DiMaggio , Michael Donovan , Phil LaMarr and currently Rick Zieff would all perform Spike 's voice . Tyke 's vocal effects are provided by Frank Welker and speaking roles by Patric Zimmerman .",

Shakespeare may also have drawn on an earlier Elizabethan play known today as the Ur - Hamlet , though some scholars believe he himself wrote the Ur - Hamlet , later revising it to create the version of Hamlet we now have . He almost certainly wrote his version of the title role for his fellow actor , Richard Burbage , the leading tragedian of Shakespeare 's time . In the 400 years since its inception , the role has been performed by numerous highly acclaimed actors in each successive century .",

    "paragraph_text": "Brain tissue consumes a large amount of energy in proportion to its volume , so large brains place severe metabolic demands on animals . The need to limit body weight in order , for example , to fly , has apparently led to selection for a reduction of brain size in some species , such as bats . Most of the brain 's energy consumption goes into sustaining the electric charge ( membrane potential ) of neurons . Most vertebrate species devote between 2 % and 8 % of basal metabolism to the brain . In primates , however , the percentage is much higher -- in humans it rises to 20 -- 25 % . The energy consumption of the brain does not vary greatly over time , but active regions of the cerebral cortex consume somewhat more energy than inactive regions ; this forms the basis for the functional brain imaging methods PET , fMRI , and NIRS . The brain typically gets most of its energy from oxygen - dependent metabolism of glucose ( i.e. , blood sugar ) , but ketones provide a major alternative source , together with contributions from medium chain fatty acids ( caprylic and heptanoic acids ) , lactate , acetate , and possibly amino acids .",

On the other hand , even before World War I had broken out , American opinion had been more negative toward Germany than towards any other country in Europe .

    "paragraph_text": "As a technique for drawing , the closest predecesor to the pencil was Silverpoint until in 1565 ( some sources say as early as 1500 ) , a large deposit of graphite was discovered on the approach to Grey Knotts from the hamlet of Seathwaite in Borrowdale parish , Cumbria , England . This particular deposit of graphite was extremely pure and solid , and it could easily be sawn into sticks . It remains the only large - scale deposit of graphite ever found in this solid form . Chemistry was in its infancy and the substance was thought to be a form of lead . Consequently , it was called plumbago ( Latin for `` lead ore '' ) . Because the pencil core is still referred to as `` lead '' , or a `` lead '' , many people have the misconception that the graphite in the pencil is lead , and the black core of pencils is still referred to as lead , even though it never contained the element lead . The words for pencil in German ( bleistift ) , Irish ( peann luaidhe ) , Arabic ( \u0642\u0644\u0645 \u0631\u0635\u0627\u0635 qalam ra\u1e63\u0101\u1e63 ) , and some other languages literally mean lead pen .",

This was the first and only time that one of Rawls ' records managed to reach Billboard 's pop top ten .

It may be used to alleviate symptoms such as muscle spasms , pain , and hyperreflexia . The term `` muscle relaxant '' is used to refer to two major therapeutic groups : neuromuscular blockers and spasmolytics . Neuromuscular blockers act by interfering with transmission at the neuromuscular end plate and have no central nervous system ( CNS ) activity . They are often used during surgical procedures and in intensive care and emergency medicine to cause temporary paralysis . Spasmolytics , also known as `` centrally acting '' muscle relaxants , are used to alleviate musculoskeletal pain and spasms and to reduce spasticity in a variety of neurological conditions . While both neuromuscular blockers and spasmolytics are often grouped together as muscle relaxants , the term is commonly used to refer to spasmolytics only .",

The word `` Toyopet ( Japanese article ) '' was a nickname given to the Toyota SA due to its small size , as the result of a naming contest the Toyota Company organized in 1947 . However , when Toyota eventually entered the American market in 1957 with the Crown , the name was not well received due to connotations of toys and pets . The name was soon dropped for the American market , but continued in other markets until the mid-1960s .",

Over the next two years , a coalition of social reform groups and labor advocates in Boston pushed for minimum wage legislation in the state . In 1912 , Massachusetts passed the first American minimum wage legislation , which established a state commission for recommending non-compulsory minimum wages for women and children . Within eight years , at least thirteen U.S. states and the District of Columbia would pass minimum wage laws , with pressure being placed on state legislatures by the National Consumers League in a coalition with other women 's voluntary associations and organized labor . The United States Supreme Court of the Lochner era consistently invalidated compulsory minimum wage laws . Advocates for these minimum wage laws hoped that they would be upheld under the precedent of Muller v. Oregon , which upheld maximum working hours laws for women on the grounds that women required special protection that men did not . However , the Court did not extend this principle to minimum wage laws , considering the latter as interfering with the ability of employers to freely negotiate wage contracts with employees .",

The third U.S. President ( 1801 -- 09 ) , Thomas Jefferson , is featured on the obverse of the note . The reverse features an engraving of the painting The Declaration of Independence by John Trumbull . Throughout the $2 bill 's pre-1929 life as a large - sized note , it was issued as a United States Note , National Bank Note , silver certificate , Treasury or `` Coin '' Note and Federal Reserve Bank Note . When U.S. currency was changed to its current size , the $2 bill was issued only as a United States Note . Production went on until 1966 , when the series was discontinued . Ten years passed before the $2 bill was reissued as a Federal Reserve Note with a new reverse design . Two - dollar bills are seldom seen in circulation as a result of banking policies with businesses which has resulted in low production numbers due to lack of demand . This comparative scarcity in circulation , coupled with a lack of public knowledge that the bill is still in production and circulation , has also inspired urban legends and occasionally has created problems for people trying to use the bill to make purchases .",

    "paragraph_text": "From 1976 to 1983 , several states voluntarily raised their purchase ages to 19 ( or , less commonly , 20 or 21 ) , in part to combat drunk driving fatalities . In 1984 , Congress passed the National Minimum Drinking Age Act , which required states to raise their ages for purchase and public possession to 21 by October 1986 or lose 10 % of their federal highway funds . By mid-1988 , all 50 states and the District of Columbia had raised their purchase ages to 21 ( but not Puerto Rico , Guam , or the Virgin Islands , see Additional Notes below ) . South Dakota and Wyoming were the final two states to comply with the age 21 mandate . The current drinking age of 21 remains a point of contention among many Americans , because of it being higher than the age of majority ( 18 in most states ) and higher than the drinking ages of most other countries . The National Minimum Drinking Age Act is also seen as a congressional sidestep of the tenth amendment . Although debates have not been highly publicized , a few states have proposed legislation to lower their drinking age , while Guam has raised its drinking age to 21 in July 2010 .",

The name Permanente came from Permanente Creek , which flowed past Henry Kaiser 's first cement plant on Black Mountain in Cupertino , California . Kaiser 's first wife , Bess Fosburgh , liked the name . An abandoned Oakland facility was modernized as the 170 - bed Permanente Hospital opened on August 1 , 1942 . Three weeks later , the 71 - bed Richmond Field Hospital opened . Six first aid stations were set up in the shipyards to treat industrial accidents and minor illness . Each first aid station had an ambulance ready to rush patients to the surgical field hospital if required . Stabilized patients could be moved to the larger hospital for recuperative care . The Northern Permanente Hospital opened two weeks later to serve workers at the Kaiser shipyard in Vancouver , Washington . Shipyard workers paid seven cents per day for comprehensive health care coverage ; and within a year the shipyard health plan employed sixty physicians with salaries between $450 and $1,000 per month . These physicians established California Physicians Service to offer similar health coverage to the families of shipyard workers . In 1944 , Kaiser decided to continue the program after the war and to open it up to the general public .",

The epidermis can be further subdivided into the following strata ( beginning with the outermost layer ) : corneum , lucidum ( only in palms of hands and bottoms of feet ) , granulosum , spinosum , basale . Cells are formed through mitosis at the basale layer . The daughter cells ( see cell division ) move up the strata changing shape and composition as they die due to isolation from their blood source . The cytoplasm is released and the protein keratin is inserted . They eventually reach the corneum and slough off ( desquamation ) . This process is called `` keratinization '' . This keratinized layer of skin is responsible for keeping water in the body and keeping other harmful chemicals and pathogens out , making skin a natural barrier to infection .",

Although the building was in use from April 1891 , the official opening night was May 5 , with a concert conducted by maestro Walter Damrosch and great Russian composer Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky . Originally known simply as `` Music Hall '' ( the words `` Music Hall founded by Andrew Carnegie '' still appear on the fa\u00e7ade above the marquee ) , the hall was renamed Carnegie Hall in 1893 after board members of the Music Hall Company of New York ( the hall 's original governing body ) persuaded Carnegie to allow the use of his name . Several alterations were made to the building between 1893 and 1896 , including the addition of two towers of artists ' studios , and alterations to the smaller auditorium on the building 's lower level .",

Unlike the earlier Act , this statute did not prohibit the colonies from issuing paper money , but it did forbid them from designating future currency emissions as legal tender for public and private debts . This tight money policy created financial difficulties in the colonies , where gold and silver were in short supply . Benjamin Franklin , a colonial agent in London , lobbied for repeal of the Act over the next several years , as did other agents . The act arose when Virginia farmers continued to import during the French and Indian War . Virginia issued 250,000 pounds in bills of credit to finance both public and private debts . This legislation differed from the 1751 act in that it prohibited the colonists from designating paper currency for use as payment for any debts , public or private . Parliament did not , however , prohibit the colonists from issuing paper money . The Act was put into place as a hedge against risks associated with economic fluctuations and uncertainty .",

Acid rain is caused by emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide , which react with the water molecules in the atmosphere to produce acids . Some governments have made efforts since the 1970s to reduce the release of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide into the atmosphere with positive results . Nitrogen oxides can also be produced naturally by lightning strikes , and sulfur dioxide is produced by volcanic eruptions . Acid rain has been shown to have adverse impacts on forests , freshwaters and soils , killing insect and aquatic life - forms , causing paint to peel , corrosion of steel structures such as bridges , and weathering of stone buildings and statues as well as having impacts on human health .",

The mutation is a deletion of three nucleotides spanning positions 507 and 508 of the CFTR gene on chromosome 7 , which ultimately results in the loss of a single codon for the amino acid phenylalanine ( F ) . A person with the CFTR\u0394F508 mutation will produce an abnormal CFTR protein that lacks this phenylalanine residue and which can not fold properly . This protein does not escape the endoplasmic reticulum for further processing . Having two copies of this mutation ( one inherited from each parent ) is by far the most common cause of cystic fibrosis ( CF ) , responsible for nearly two - thirds of cases worldwide .",

    "paragraph_text": "Seafloor spreading is a process that occurs at mid-ocean ridges , where new oceanic crust is formed through volcanic activity and then gradually moves away from the ridge . Seafloor spreading helps explain continental drift in the theory of plate tectonics . When oceanic plates diverge , tensional stress causes fractures to occur in the lithosphere. The motivating force for seafloor spreading ridges is tectonic plate pull rather than magma pressure , although there is typically significant magma activity at spreading ridges . At a spreading center basaltic magma rises up the fractures and cools on the ocean floor to form new seabed . Hydrothermal vents are common at spreading centers . Older rocks will be found farther away from the spreading zone while younger rocks will be found nearer to the spreading zone . Additionally spreading rates determine if the ridge is a fast , intermediate , or slow . As a general rule , fast ridges see spreading rate of more than 9 cm / year . Intermediate ridges have a spreading rate of 4 -- 9 cm / year while slow spreading ridges have a rate less than 4 cm / year .",

The Bonhomme Richard and Serapis entered a bitter engagement at about 6 : 00 p.m. The battle continued for the next four hours , costing the lives of nearly half of the American and British crews . British victory seemed inevitable , as the more heavily armed Serapis used its firepower to rake Bonhomme Richard with devastating effect . The commander of the Serapis finally called on Jones to surrender . He replied , `` Sir , I have not yet begun to fight ! '' Jones eventually managed to lash the ships together , nullifying his opponent 's greater maneuverability and allowing him to take advantage of the larger size and considerably more numerous crew of Bonhomme Richard . An attempt by the Americans to board Serapis was repulsed , as was an attempt by the British to board Bonhomme Richard . Finally , after another of Jones 's ships joined the fight , the British captain was forced to surrender at about 10 : 30 p.m. The Bonhomme Richard -- shattered , on fire , leaking badly -- defied all efforts to save her and sank about 36 hours later at 11 : 00 a.m. on Saturday , 25 September 1779 . Jones sailed the captured Serapis to the Dutch United Provinces for repairs .",

    "paragraph_text": "In meteorology , precipitation is any product of the condensation of atmospheric water vapor that falls under gravity . The main forms of precipitation include drizzle , rain , sleet , snow , graupel and hail . Precipitation occurs when a portion of the atmosphere becomes saturated with water vapor , so that the water condenses and `` precipitates '' . Thus , fog and mist are not precipitation but suspensions , because the water vapor does not condense sufficiently to precipitate . Two processes , possibly acting together , can lead to air becoming saturated : cooling the air or adding water vapor to the air . Precipitation forms as smaller droplets coalesce via collision with other rain drops or ice crystals within a cloud . Short , intense periods of rain in scattered locations are called `` showers .

Romanticism was characterized by its emphasis on emotion and individualism as well as glorification of all the past and nature , preferring the medieval rather than the classical . It was partly a reaction to the Industrial Revolution , the aristocratic social and political norms of the Age of Enlightenment , and the scientific rationalization of nature -- all components of modernity . It was embodied most strongly in the visual arts , music , and literature , but had a major impact on historiography , education , and the natural sciences . It had a significant and complex effect on politics , with romantic thinkers influencing liberalism , radicalism , conservatism and nationalism .",

Each `` ow '' sound in the phrase represents the diphthong / a\u028a / . Although orthographies for each of the four words in this utterance is represented by the English spelling `` ow '' , the articulation required to create this same diphthong represented by the International Phonetic Association 's phonetic alphabet as / a\u028a / is also represented by the spelling `` ou '' . Some examples of these homophonic / a\u028a / 's are the English words `` house '' , `` blouse '' , `` noun '' , and `` cloud '' . The use of the phrase `` how now brown cow '' in teaching elocution can be dated back to at least 1926 . Although not in use today , the phrase `` how now '' is a greeting , short for `` how say you now '' , and can be found in archaic literature , such as the plays of William Shakespeare .",

A Jesuit priest named Luigi Taparelli is typically credited with coining the term , and it spread during the revolutions of 1848 with the work of Antonio Rosmini - Serbati . In the late industrial revolution , progressive American legal scholars began to use the term more , particularly Louis Brandeis and Roscoe Pound . From the early 20th century it was also embedded in international law and institutions ; the preamble to establish the International Labour Organization recalled that `` universal and lasting peace can be established only if it is based upon social justice . '' In the later 20th century , social justice was made central to the philosophy of the social contract , primarily by John Rawls in A Theory of Justice ( 1971 ) . In 1993 , the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action treats social justice as a purpose of human rights education .",

Gutenberg , a goldsmith by profession , developed a printing system , by adapting existing technologies to printing purposes , as well as making inventions of his own . His newly devised hand mould made possible the precise and rapid creation of metal movable type in large quantities . Movable type had been hitherto unknown in Europe . In East Asia , where it was invented , the usefulness of movable type was limited by the complexity of the writing system and , without the hand mould , the production of sorts ( individual letters of type ) was slow . In Europe , the two inventions , the hand mould and the printing press , together drastically reduced the cost of printing books and other documents , particularly in short print runs .",

It lists `` Judas the son of James '' instead of `` Thaddeus '' . ( For more information , see Jude the Apostle . ) Unlike the Synoptic Gospels , the Gospel of John does not offer a formal list of apostles . Although it refers to `` the Twelve '' ( John 6 : 67 -- 71 ) , the gospel does not present any elaboration of who these twelve actually were , and the author of the Gospel of John does not mention them all by name .

The Wijnbergen Roll , a French roll of arms dating from c. 1280 and preserved in The Hague , Netherlands , attributed `` D'azure a la harpe d'or '' ( English : Blue with a harp of gold ) to the King of Ireland ( `` le Roi d'Irlande '' ) . The harp , traditionally associated with King David , was a rare charge on medieval rolls and only two arms with a harp are listed in a collection of 19 early rolls . Triangular devices appeared on medieval Irish coinage by kings John and Edward I in the 12th and 13th centuries . These devices may have been crude harps or it may be that the harp developed from the use of triangles to distinguish Irish coins . The idea of a harp being the arms of Ireland may have originated as a reference to a fictional character , le roi d'irelande , in the courtly legend cycle of Tristan . Alternatively , it may have derived from a celebrated 13th century bardic poem , Tabhroidh Chugam Cruit mo Riogh , dedicated to the Donnchadh Cairbreach O'Briain ( d . 1242 ) , a Gaelic King of Thomond .",

    "paragraph_text": "Scott Hudson enters J.P. Zenger High as a freshman , along with his three best friends , Mitch , Patrick , and Kyle , and quickly realizes that it is very different from middle school . Upperclassmen are intimidating and will steal any lunch money along with loose change if you stand in the wrong place . Scott gets put in advanced classes , including an Honors English class which , despite the amount of homework , is his favorite class . His teacher , Mr. Franka , becomes a mentor to him . Scott finds out that he 's not in classes with his friends since he 's carrying all honors and college prep classes . He tries his best from the very start to get the attention of Julia Baskins , a girl who was in his kindergarten class and has recently become very beautiful over the summer . Because of her beauty she quickly blends in with the popular girls and is attracted to the football players who are often bullying Scott . Scott is also connected to another classmate named Louden , who is better known as Mouth . Scott tries every attempt to get Julia 's attention such as joining the school paper , because he thinks that she is part of the staff , only to discover that she has written only a single column for the paper . He then runs for student council , after finding out that Julia is also running as well , and wins a seat , only to find out that she has not won . Because of this , Scott resigns from his position on the student council . It turns out that a lot of other members also resigned including the president meaning Julia who happened to have the 2nd most amount of votes is now president . He also auditions for the school play and is selected as a member of the crew , thinking that Julia is also auditioning for the play . However , Julia has not been selected as a member of the cast or crew . Soon , a new girl named Lee arrives at school , who wears face pins and weird clothes , and has wildly colored hair . Both soon realize that they share the same interests , but he ca n't get past his crush on Julia . Scott suddenly has another `` friend '' named Wesley , a high school senior . Though they share some interests , they have little in common . Then to put the cherry on top of all this excitement going on in his life , his mother announces that she is pregnant . He copes with all of this by creating a tip book for his soon - to - be baby sibling to help him , or her , survive high school when they get to it . In his entries to the baby , he often shows disdain by using degrading terms to talk to it such as `` Smelly '' or `` Blob of unformed goo '' . But he writes it to be a good older brother to this new baby since Scott 's own brother was never very present . As time goes by , Scott tries to find his place , but he starts to lose his best friends . Mitch finds a girlfriend and soon forgets the group , Patrick moves to Texas , then to Japan , and Kyle joins the wrestling team and soon puts Scott down for having a crush on Julia . Soon , Julia 's boyfriend Vernon beats up Scott after finding out from Kyle ( who lost a fight with Scott ) that Scott has a crush on his girlfriend . Scott realizes that what a person says and does can affect the life of another after Mouth attempts to commit suicide . Later , he learns that not everything is what it seems once he finds out that his older brother , Bobby , who is struggling to find a job , can barely read . Scott 's mother eventually gives birth to a new baby boy , whom they name Sean . Meanwhile , Bobby finds a job through guitar - playing and Julia eventually starts dating a nicer guy , though she is now close to Scott enough to give him a kiss on the cheek .",

It is divided into two layers , the superficial area adjacent to the epidermis called the papillary region and a deep thicker area known as the reticular dermis . The dermis is tightly connected to the epidermis through a basement membrane . Structural components of the dermis are collagen , elastic fibers , and extrafibrillar matrix . It also contains mechanoreceptors that provide the sense of touch and thermoreceptors that provide the sense of heat . In addition , hair follicles , sweat glands , sebaceous glands , apocrine glands , lymphatic vessels and blood vessels are present in the dermis . Those blood vessels provide nourishment and waste removal for both dermal and epidermal cells .",

    "question_text": "when was kudzu introduced to the united states",
    "paragraph_text": "The kudzu plant was introduced to the United States from Japan in 1876 at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia . Kudzu was introduced to the Southeast in 1883 at the New Orleans Exposition . The vine was widely marketed in the Southeast as an ornamental plant to be used to shade porches , and in the first half of the 20th century , kudzu was distributed as a high - protein content cattle fodder and as a cover plant to prevent soil erosion . It was cultivated by Civilian Conservation Corps workers as a solution for the erosion during the Dust Bowl . The Soil Erosion Service recommended the use of kudzu to help control erosion of slopes which led to the government - aided distribution of 85 million seedlings and government - funded plantings of kudzu which paid $19.75 per hectare . By 1946 , it was estimated that 1,200,000 hectares ( 3,000,000 acres ) of kudzu had been planted . When boll weevil infestations and the failure of cotton crops caused farmers to abandon their farms , kudzu plantings were left unattended . The climate and environment of the Southeastern United States allowed the kudzu to grow virtually unchecked . In 1953 the United States Department of Agriculture removed kudzu from a list of suggested cover plants and listed it as a weed in 1970 . By 1997 , the vine was placed on the `` Federal Noxious Weed List '' . Today , kudzu is estimated to cover 3,000,000 hectares ( 7,400,000 acres ) of land in the southeastern United States , mostly in Alabama , Georgia , Tennessee , Florida , North Carolina , South Carolina and Mississippi . It has been recorded in Nova Scotia , Canada , in Columbus , Ohio , and in all five boroughs of New York City .",

The culmination of the Yorktown campaign , the siege proved to be the last major land battle of the American Revolutionary War in the North American theater , as the surrender by Cornwallis , and the capture of both him and his army , prompted the British government to negotiate an end to the conflict . The battle boosted faltering American morale and revived French enthusiasm for the war , as well as undermining popular support for the conflict in Great Britain .",

Plasmodesmata evolved independently in several lineages , and species that have these structures include members of the Charophyceae , Charales , Coleochaetales and Phaeophyceae ( which are all algae ) , as well as all embryophytes , better known as land plants . Unlike animal cells , almost every plant cell is surrounded by a polysaccharide cell wall . Neighbouring plant cells are therefore separated by a pair of cell walls and the intervening middle lamella , forming an extracellular domain known as the apoplast . Although cell walls are permeable to small soluble proteins and other solutes , plasmodesmata enable direct , regulated , symplastic transport of substances between cells . There are two forms of plasmodesmata : primary plasmodesmata , which are formed during cell division , and secondary plasmodesmata , which can form between mature cells .",

Gestalt psychology is an attempt to understand the laws behind the ability to acquire and maintain meaningful perceptions in an apparently chaotic world . The central principle of gestalt psychology is that the mind forms a global whole with self - organizing tendencies . The assumed physiological mechanisms on which Gestalt theory rests are poorly defined and support for their existence is lacking . The Gestalt theory of perception has been criticized as being descriptive of the end products of perception without providing much insight into the processes that lead to perception . In the introduction to a 2016 special issue of the journal Vision Research on Gestalt perception , the authors concluded that `` even though they study the same phenomena as earlier Gestaltists , there is little theoretical coherence . What happened to the Gestalt school that always aspired to provide a unified vision of psychology ? Perhaps there is , in fact , little that holds the classic phenomena of Gestalt psychology together . ''",

AD 400 , with Constantinople ( New Rome ) becoming the largest around AD 500 , and the Empire 's populace grew to an estimated 50 to 90 million inhabitants ( roughly 20 % of the world 's population at the time ) . The 500 - year - old republic which preceded it was severely destabilized in a series of civil wars and political conflict , during which Julius Caesar was appointed as perpetual dictator and then assassinated in 44 BC . Civil wars and executions continued , culminating in the victory of Octavian , Caesar 's adopted son , over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the annexation of Egypt . Octavian 's power was then unassailable and in 27 BC the Roman Senate formally granted him overarching power and the new title Augustus , effectively marking the end of the Roman Republic .",

    "paragraph_text": "Initially , the US stores were the result of natural expansion in Canada -- US border areas ( e.g. , stores in Maine and the Buffalo , New York area where Horton played from 1972 to 1974 as a member of the Buffalo Sabres ) . The first United States locations were opened in Deerfield Beach , Florida and Pompano Beach , Florida in 1981 , but they proved unsuccessful and were closed . In 1985 , the chain returned to the US with a location on Niagara Falls Boulevard in the Buffalo suburb of Amherst , New York . Starting in the mid-1990s , however , the chain began expanding in the US by acquiring former locations from fast food chains . In 1996 and 1997 , thirty - seven former Rax Restaurants locations in Ohio , Kentucky , and West Virginia were bought by Wendy 's International Inc. ; 30 of these were converted to Tim Hortons , while the others became Wendy 's franchise locations . Thirty - five closed Hardee 's stores in the Detroit area were also purchased with the intention of being converted . By 2004 , the chain had also acquired 42 Bess Eaton coffee and doughnut restaurants situated in southern New England . Several combination Wendy 's / Tim Hortons units were opened in the US ; both in the `` traditional '' markets of Maine and Buffalo , where there were well over 180 locations as of 2011 , and in the markets entered through acquisition .",

    "paragraph_text": "`` Wah - Wah '' is a song by English musician George Harrison , released on his 1970 triple album All Things Must Pass . Harrison wrote the song following his temporary departure from the Beatles in January 1969 , during the troubled Get Back sessions that resulted in their Let It Be album and film . The lyrics reflect his frustration with the atmosphere in the group at that time -- namely , Paul McCartney 's over-assertiveness and criticism of his guitar playing , John Lennon 's lack of engagement with the project and dismissal of Harrison as a songwriter , and Yoko Ono 's constant involvement in the band 's activities . Music critics and biographers recognise the song as Harrison 's statement of personal and artistic freedom from the Beatles . Its creation contrasted sharply with his rewarding collaborations outside the group in the months before the Get Back project , particularly with Bob Dylan and the Band in upstate New York .",

Attached to the fuel tank , four prongs hold the glass chimney , which acts to prevent the flame from being blown out and enhances a thermally induced draft . The glass chimney needs a `` throat '' , or slight constriction , to create the proper draft for complete combustion of the fuel ; the draft carries more air ( oxygen ) past the flame , helping to produce a smokeless light , which is brighter than an open flame would produce .",

The name derives from the common use of performing dogs and ponies as the main attractions of the events . Performances were generally held in open - air arenas , such as race tracks or public spaces in localities that were too small or remote to attract larger , more elaborate performers or performances . The most notorious was `` Prof. Gentry 's Famous Dog & Pony Show , '' started when teenager Henry Gentry and his brothers started touring in 1886 with their act , originally entitled `` Gentry 's Equine and Canine Paradox . '' It started small , but evolved into a full circus show . Other early dog and pony shows included Morris ' Equine and Canine Paradoxes ( 1883 ) and Hurlburt 's Dog and Pony Show ( late 1880s ) .",

It lies within the London Borough of Tower Hamlets , separated from the eastern edge of the square mile of the City of London by the open space known as Tower Hill . It was founded towards the end of 1066 as part of the Norman Conquest of England . The White Tower , which gives the entire castle its name , was built by William the Conqueror in 1078 and was a resented symbol of oppression , inflicted upon London by the new ruling elite . The castle was used as a prison from 1100 ( Ranulf Flambard ) until 1952 ( Kray twins ) , although that was not its primary purpose . A grand palace early in its history , it served as a royal residence . As a whole , the Tower is a complex of several buildings set within two concentric rings of defensive walls and a moat . There were several phases of expansion , mainly under Kings Richard I , Henry III , and Edward I in the 12th and 13th centuries . The general layout established by the late 13th century remains despite later activity on the site .",

    "paragraph_text": "Food is ingested through the mouth and when swallowed passes first into the pharynx and then into the esophagus . The esophagus is thus one of the first components of the digestive system and the gastrointestinal tract . After food passes through the esophagus , it enters the stomach . When food is being swallowed , the epiglottis moves backward to cover the larynx , preventing food from entering the trachea . At the same time , the upper esophageal sphincter relaxes , allowing a bolus of food to enter . Peristaltic contractions of the esophageal muscle push the food down the esophagus . These rhythmic contractions occur both as a reflex response to food that is in the mouth , and also as a response to the sensation of food within the esophagus itself . Along with peristalsis , the lower esophageal sphincter relaxes .",

In the poem , an albatross starts to follow a ship -- being followed by an albatross was generally considered a sign of good luck . However , the titular mariner shoots the albatross with a crossbow , which is regarded as an act that will curse the ship ( which indeed suffers terrible mishaps ) . Even when they are too thirsty to speak , the ship 's crew let the mariner know through their glances that they blame his action for the curse . The albatross is then literally hung around the mariner 's neck by the crew to symbolize his guilt in killing the bird . Thus , the albatross can be both an omen of good or bad luck , as well as a metaphor for a burden to be carried as penance .",

McClure in multiple American newspapers and then published in the British publication Black and White in April 1892 and the following year as the title story in the collection , The Real Thing and Other Stories published by Macmillan . This story , often read as a parable , plays with the reality - illusion dichotomy that fascinated James , especially in the later stages of his career . For the illustrator who narrates the story , the genuine article proves all too useless for his commercial purposes . The story portrays the unfortunate victims of a society in which reality and representation are closely intertwined in ways that make art a difficult project to untangle the two .",

    "paragraph_text": "There was a lengthy dispute over the leadership of the Senate during June and July 2009 . On June 8 , 2009 , Democrats Hiram Monserrate and Pedro Espada , Jr. , joined the 30 Republican members of the State Senate to attempt to issue a motion to replace current Majority Leader Malcolm Smith with Minority Leader Dean Skelos . Following the precedent of 1913 , the temporary presidency and the majority leadership would have been separated again under this scenario . Since the office of Lieutenant Governor fell vacant after Lt. Gov. David Paterson succeeded to the governorship upon Gov. Eliot Spitzer 's resignation , the majority leaders ( Bruno , Skelos and Smith ) have acted as lieutenant governors . The motions put forward on June 8 also sought to select Pedro Espada as Temporary President of the State Senate , which would have installed him as acting lieutenant governor . The Democrats have disputed the legitimacy of the motions put forward on June 8 . The New York State Senate has been providing a running update of the legal proceedings since June 11 , 2009 . The dispute ended July 9 , 2009 , when Senator Espada announced he would return to the Democratic caucus and take on the position of majority leader , while it was also announced that former majority leader Malcolm Smith had assumed the title of president pro tempore , and John Sampson would serve as Democratic conference leader with the understanding he would assume the presidency at an undetermined future date . Following the 2010 election and the Republican victory in the Senate , Senator Dean Skelos from Long Island served as both Temporary President and Majority Leader , but resigned in May 2015 in the midst of corruption charges . The current majority leader , or president , is John J. Flanagan .",

Most E. coli strains are harmless , but some serotypes can cause serious food poisoning in their hosts , and are occasionally responsible for product recalls due to food contamination . The harmless strains are part of the normal flora of the gut , and can benefit their hosts by producing vitamin K , and preventing colonization of the intestine with pathogenic bacteria , having a symbiotic relationship . E. coli is expelled into the environment within fecal matter . The bacterium grows massively in fresh fecal matter under aerobic conditions for 3 days , but its numbers decline slowly afterwards .",

The remaining 25 signatories present were called up in alphabetical order to sign , leaving spaces for those absent . Although a space was left for him between the signatures of Eliyahu Dobkin and Meir Vilner , Zerach Warhaftig signed at the top of the next column , leading to speculation that Vilner 's name had been left alone to isolate him , or to stress that even a communist agreed with the declaration . However , Warhaftig later denied this , stating that a space had been left for him ( as he was one of the signatories trapped in Jerusalem ) where a Hebraicised form of his name would have fitted alphabetically , but he insisted on signing under his actual name so as to honour his father 's memory and so moved down two spaces . He and Vilner would be the last surviving signatories , and remained close for the rest of their lives . Of the signatories , two were women ( Golda Meir ( Meyerson / Myerson ) and Rachel Cohen - Kagan ) .",

The award announcement acknowledged the fact that `` the world 's nine nuclear - armed powers and their allies '' neither signed nor supported the treaty - based prohibition known as the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons or nuclear ban treaty , yet in an interview Committee Chair Berit Reiss - Andersen told reporters that the award was intended to give `` encouragement to all players in the field '' to disarm . The award was hailed by civil society as well as governmental and intergovernmental representatives who support the nuclear ban treaty , but drew criticism from those opposed . At the Nobel Peace Prize award ceremony held in Oslo City Hall on December 10 , 2017 , Setsuko Thurlow , an 85 - year - old survivor of the 1945 atomic bombing of Hiroshima , and ICAN Executive Director Beatrice Fihn jointly received a medal and diploma of the award on behalf of ICAN and delivered the Nobel lecture .",

    "paragraph_text": "Although the Justice League first appeared in season six 's `` Justice '' , each member had their own introduction and recurring storylines in the series prior to the formation of the team . The first member to appear on Smallville , other than Clark Kent ( Tom Welling ) , was Bart Allen ( Kyle Gallner ) , who was introduced in the season four episode `` Run '' . In the episode , Bart is the first person Clark discovers to have a superhuman ability -- being able to run at supersonic speeds -- that was not created from exposure to kryptonite . When Clark and Bart first meet , Bart is a pickpocket who saves Jonathan Kent ( John Schneider ) from being hit by a truck . Eventually , Clark convinces Bart to give up his life of crime . Arthur Curry ( Alan Ritchson ) , who has the ability to swim at superhuman speeds and create energy blasts through the water , is next to appear in the season five episode `` Aqua '' . Arthur arrives in Smallville to stop an underwater weapon developed by Lex Luthor ( Michael Rosenbaum ) , which is killing the surrounding ocean life . Arthur and Clark initially clash on Arthur 's tactics ; Arthur tries to blow up Lex 's lab , while Clark insists that they should simply talk to Lex face - to - face and ask him to stop . Eventually , Arthur and Clark locate and destroy the weapon outright . Season five also introduced Victor Stone ( Lee Thompson Young ) in the episode `` Cyborg '' . Here , it is revealed that Victor was mortally wounded in a car accident that also took the lives of his family , but Lex 's company , LuthorCorp , took Victor 's body to a research lab where they experimented on him -- ultimately replacing his bone skeleton with a metal one . Clark attempts to provide Victor with a safe haven after Victor escapes from Lex 's facility . Clark manages to convince Lex to stop hunting Victor , who eventually leaves Smallville with his girlfriend .",

    "paragraph_text": "Easter eggs , also called Paschal eggs , are decorated eggs that are usually used as gifts on the occasion of Easter . As such , Easter eggs are common during the season of Eastertide ( Easter season ) . The oldest tradition is to use dyed and painted chicken eggs , but a modern custom is to substitute chocolate eggs wrapped in colourful foil , hand - carved wooden eggs , or plastic eggs filled with confectionery such as chocolate . However , real eggs continue to be used in Eastern European tradition . Although eggs , in general , were a traditional symbol of fertility and rebirth , in Christianity , for the celebration of Eastertide , Easter eggs symbolize the empty tomb of Jesus , from which Jesus resurrected . In addition , one ancient tradition was the staining of Easter eggs with the colour red `` in memory of the blood of Christ , shed as at that time of his crucifixion . '' This custom of the Easter egg can be traced to early Christians of Mesopotamia , and from there it spread into Russia and Siberia through the Orthodox Churches , and later into Europe through the Catholic and Protestant Churches . This Christian use of eggs may have been influenced by practices in `` pre-dynastic period in Egypt , as well as amid the early cultures of Mesopotamia and Crete '' .",

Chymotrypsin preferentially cleaves peptide amide bonds where the side - chain of the amino acid N - terminal to the scissile amide bond ( the P position ) is a large hydrophobic amino acid ( tyrosine , tryptophan , and phenylalanine ) . These amino acids contain an aromatic ring in their sidechain that fits into a ' hydrophobic pocket ' ( the S position ) of the enzyme . It is activated in the presence of trypsin . The hydrophobic and shape complementarity between the peptide substrate P sidechain and the enzyme S binding cavity accounts for the substrate specificity of this enzyme .

Originally , the Great Pyramid was covered by limestone casing stones that formed a smooth outer surface ; what is seen today is the underlying core structure . Some of the casing stones that once covered the structure can still be seen around the base . There have been varying scientific and alternative theories about the Great Pyramid 's construction techniques . Most accepted construction hypotheses are based on the idea that it was built by moving huge stones from a quarry and dragging and lifting them into place .",

    "paragraph_text": "The peripheral nervous system ( PNS ) is one of the two components of the nervous system , the other part is the central nervous system ( CNS ) . The PNS consists of the nerves and ganglia outside the brain and spinal cord . The main function of the PNS is to connect the CNS to the limbs and organs , essentially serving as a relay between the brain and spinal cord and the rest of the body . Unlike the CNS , the PNS is not protected by the vertebral column and skull , or by the blood -- brain barrier , which leaves it exposed to toxins and mechanical injuries . The peripheral nervous system is divided into the somatic nervous system and the autonomic nervous system . In the somatic nervous system , the cranial nerves are part of the PNS with the exception of the optic nerve ( cranial nerve II ) , along with the retina . The second cranial nerve is not a true peripheral nerve but a tract of the diencephalon . Cranial nerve ganglia originated in the CNS . However , the remaining ten cranial nerve axons extend beyond the brain and are therefore considered part of the PNS . The autonomic nervous system is an involuntary control of smooth muscle and glands . The connection between CNS and organs allows the system to be in two different functional states : sympathetic and parasympathetic .",

In the late sixteenth century , Nurhaci , originally a Ming vassal , began organizing `` Banners '' , military - social units that included Jurchen , Han Chinese , and Mongol elements . Nurhaci formed the Jurchen clans into a unified entity , which he renamed as the Manchus . By 1636 , his son Hong Taiji began driving Ming forces out of Liaodong and declared a new dynasty , the Qing . In 1644 , peasant rebels led by Li Zicheng conquered the Ming capital , Beijing . Rather than serve them , Ming general Wu Sangui made an alliance with the Manchus and opened the Shanhai Pass to the Banner Armies led by the regent Prince Dorgon , who defeated the rebels and seized the capital . Resistance from the Southern Ming and the Revolt of the Three Feudatories led by Wu Sangui extended the conquest of China proper for nearly four decades and was not completed until 1683 under the Kangxi Emperor ( r . 1661 -- 1722 ) . The Ten Great Campaigns of the Qianlong Emperor from the 1750s to the 1790s extended Qing control into Inner Asia . The early rulers maintained their Manchu ways , and while their title was Emperor , they used `` Bogd khaan '' to the Mongols and they were patrons of Tibetan Buddhism . They governed using Confucian styles and institutions of bureaucratic government and retained the imperial examinations to recruit Han Chinese to work under or in parallel with Manchus . They also adapted the ideals of the tributary system in dealing with neighboring territories .",

According to ancient Greek mythology it was believed that Gaea the Greek goddess mother of Titans gave ' a sickle was made out of the strongest metal ' to her youngest son ' Kronos ' who is also youngest of Titans ( also known as God of Harvest ) to seek vengeance against her Husband Ouranos for Torturing their oldest sons . To illustrate this , Smith cites an image of Saturn holding a scythe , from an ancient Italian cameo . The Grim Reaper and the Greek Titan Cronus were often depicted carrying or wielding a scythe . According to Jack Herer and `` Flesh of The Gods '' ( Emboden , W.A. , Jr. , Praeger Press , NY , 1974 . ) ; the ancient Scythians grew hemp and harvested it with a hand reaper that we still call a scythe .",

Cone cells are densely packed in the fovea centralis , a 0.3 mm diameter rod - free area with very thin , densely packed cones which quickly reduce in number towards the periphery of the retina . There are about six to seven million cones in a human eye and are most concentrated towards the macula . The commonly cited figure of six million cone cells in the human eye was found by Osterberg in 1935 . Oyster 's textbook ( 1999 ) cites work by Curcio et al. ( 1990 ) indicating an average close to 4.5 million cone cells and 90 million rod cells in the human retina .",

    "paragraph_text": "`` I Write Sins Not Tragedies '' is a song by American rock band Panic ! at the Disco , and is the second single from their debut studio album , A Fever You Ca n't Sweat Out ( 2005 ) . It was released on April 27 , 2006 on both CD and 7 '' vinyl . The pizzicato cello motif that the song is built upon was played by session musician Heather Stebbins . The song reached No. 7 on the United States Billboard Hot 100 . This was the band 's only top forty hit until the release of `` Hallelujah '' in 2015 . While the song failed to hit the top 10 on the Alternative Songs chart peaking at No. 12 which was lower than their prior single , `` The Only Difference Between Martyrdom and Suicide Is Press Coverage '' which peaked at No. 5 , the song 's success on the Hot 100 and Mainstream Top 40 ( at No. 2 ) charts was what made the song one of the biggest modern rock hits of 2006 and is still one of the band 's most played songs on alternative radio stations to this day .",

The two teams have met 11 times in the World Series , more times than any other pair of teams from the American and National Leagues . The initial significance was embodied in the two teams ' proximity in New York City , when the Dodgers initially played in Brooklyn . After the Dodgers moved to Los Angeles in 1958 , the rivalry retained its significance as the two teams represented the dominant cities on each coast of the United States , and since the 1980s , the two largest cities in the United States . The Dodgers currently lead the regular season series 7 - 6 . Although the rivalry 's significance arose from the two teams ' numerous World Series meetings , the Yankees and Dodgers have not met in the World Series since 1981 . They would not play each other in a non-exhibition game until 2004 , when they played a 3 - game interleague series .

There have been 28 Summer Olympic Games held in 23 cities , and 23 Winter Olympic Games held in 20 cities . In addition , three summer and two winter editions of the Games were scheduled to take place but later cancelled due to war : Berlin ( summer ) in 1916 ; Tokyo / Helsinki ( summer ) and Sapporo / Garmisch - Partenkirchen ( winter ) in 1940 ; and London ( summer ) and Cortina d'Ampezzo , Italy ( winter ) in 1944 . The 1906 Summer Olympics were officially sanctioned and held in Athens . However , in 1949 , the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) , decided to unrecognize the 1906 Games . Four cities have been chosen by the IOC to host upcoming Olympic Games : Tokyo for the 2020 Summer Olympics , Beijing for the 2022 Winter Olympics , Paris for the 2024 Summer Olympics , and Los Angeles for the 2028 Summer Olympics .",

In March 2014 Russia was suspended following the annexation of Crimea , whereupon the group 's name reverted to the G7 . Certain representatives of G7 countries stated that they would be interested in Russia 's return to the group . However in 2017 Russia announced that it would permanently leave the political forum G8 . The European Union was represented at the G8 since the 1980s as a `` nonenumerated '' participant , but originally could not host or chair summits . The 40th summit was the first time the European Union was able to host and chair a summit . Collectively , in 2012 the G8 nations comprised 50.1 percent of 2012 global nominal GDP and 40.9 percent of global GDP ( PPP ) .",

According to Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone , the song `` blends winks at Fifties doo - wop with hip - hop chants '' , comparing the style and the lyrics `` My first love broke my heart for the first time / And I was like / Baby , baby , baby , ooooh / I thought you 'd always be mine '' to fifties ballads like `` Tears on My Pillow '' , `` Why Do Fools Fall in Love '' and `` Earth Angel '' . Lyrically , Bieber 's lines explain his distress over his lost love , and promise to get it back , featured in lines like , `` And I wan na play it cool / But I 'm losin ' you ... / I 'm in pieces / So come and fix me ... '' . The chorus features the distinct and repetitive `` baby , baby , baby , ohhhh ( nooooo ) '' hook . After the second verse , Ludacris comes in with the verse - rap , an anecdote of young love when he was thirteen , as it runs `` When I was 13 / I had my first love / She had me going crazy / Oh , I was star - struck / She woke me up daily / Do n't need no Starbucks ...

Wells 's hopeful vision of the future 's possibilities gave Huxley the idea to begin writing a parody of the novel , which became Brave New World . He wrote in a letter to Mrs. Arthur Goldsmith , an American acquaintance , that he had `` been having a little fun pulling the leg of H.G. Wells , '' but then he `` got caught up in the excitement of ( his ) own ideas . '' Unlike the most popular optimist utopian novels of the time , Huxley sought to provide a frightening vision of the future . Huxley referred to Brave New World as a `` negative utopia '' , somewhat influenced by Wells 's own The Sleeper Awakes ( dealing with subjects like corporate tyranny and behavioural conditioning ) and the works of D.H. Lawrence .",

It is a key concept in the history of liberalism .

    "paragraph_text": "Daenerys Targaryen ( season 1 -- present ) portrayed by Emilia Clarke . Daenerys Targaryen is the exiled princess of the Targaryen dynasty . Also called `` the Stormborn '' , she and her brother Viserys were smuggled to Essos during the end of Robert 's Rebellion . For seventeen years , she has been under the care of Viserys , whom she fears , as he is abusive to her whenever she displeases him . In exchange for an army , Viserys marries her to the powerful Dothraki warlord Khal Drogo , making her a Khaleesi , a queen of the Dothraki . Daenerys is at first afraid of her new husband but after learning the Dothraki language , she manages to get past their barriers . She begins to understand him and genuinely falls in love with him after learning Drogo is an intelligent leader and a kind man . After embracing the Dothraki culture , she becomes stronger and rebels against her brother . She later becomes pregnant with Drogo 's son who is prophesied by the Dothraki to be the `` Stallion Who Mounts the World '' . After her brother 's death and an assassination attempt by Robert Baratheon , Drogo vows to Daenerys that he will conquer the Seven Kingdoms for her and their unborn son . However , during their journey Drogo suffers from blood poisoning due to an infected wound incurred during a fight with a Dothraki tribesman . Daenerys is forced to seek the help of healer Mirri Maz Duur to save his life using blood magic . Mirri tricks Daenerys by using her unborn son 's life as a sacrifice to heal Drogo , leaving him in a permanent catatonic state , and forcing Daenerys to end her husband 's life . Losing both her husband and son , Daenerys punishes Mirri by having her burnt at the stake . She also lays the three dragon eggs she received as a wedding gift onto Khal Drogo 's body , then steps into the burning funeral pyre . After the fire extinguishes itself , the Khaleesi and three baby dragons , named Drogon , Rhaegal , and Viserion , are found alive and unharmed . Daenerys takes the baby dragons and the remaining tribe to gather new allies and reclaim the Iron Throne . She becomes the first female Dothraki leader . In Season 2 , she is lost in the Red Waste , a stretch of barren land . She and her khalasar eventually make it to Qarth , where the nobles are more interested in her dragons than her conquering Westeros . When her dragons are stolen by Pyat Pree , she goes into the House of the Undying and retrieves them , killing Pyat Pree . In the second season 's finale , she imprisons her host Xaro Xoan Daxos for having helped Pyat Pree . Her horde loot Xaro 's mansion to buy a ship . Daenerys travels from Qarth to Astapor , a city in Slaver 's Bay , where she negotiates the purchase of elite eunuch soldiers called the Unsullied . She also meets the famed knight Ser Barristan Selmy , and accepts him into her queensguard . On her departure from the city , she frees the slaves and has Drogon torch its elders . By the end of Season 3 , although her power has not yet been tested , she has acquired the loyalty of tens of thousands of freed slaves from Astapor and Yunkai , her remaining Dothraki brethren ( and two former Westerosi soldiers whom she encountered through the Dothraki , who advise her ) 2,000 ' Second Sons ' cavalrymen , 8,000 ' Unsullied ' elite infantry , and three rapidly growing dragons . The stay in Slaver 's Bay has made her question her motives , however , and she takes up the cause of ending slavery as well , donning the honorific `` Breaker of Chains '' as the slaves hold her to the sky , praising her as their Mhysa , or `` Mother '' . Daenerys later frees the slaves from Meereen , the last of the slave cities in Slaver 's Bay , but realizes that she is slowly losing control of her dragons , especially when Drogon shows signs of aggression towards her when she tries to break up a fight between them over food . Aware that she does not have enough men to conquer Westeros just yet , Daenerys resolves to remain in Slaver 's Bay and rule as Queen for the time being . She eventually learns of Jorah 's original purpose , which was to spy on her for Robert Baratheon , and orders him to leave Meereen on threat of execution . After she receives too many complaints about her dragons , Daenerys , locks Rhaegal and Viserion of them in the catacombs beneath Meereen before searching for Drogon . Meanwhile , Daenerys faces a new threat to her rule in the form of the Sons of the Harpy , a resistance movement against her and the Unsullied . She considers freeing her dragons , but they attempt to attack her , making her realize that they are no longer loyal to her . After Daario and Grey Worm arrest a member of the Sons of the Harpy , Mossador implores Daenerys to execute their captive , but Barristan tells her of the Mad King 's actions against his enemies , which included burning them with wildfire while laughing . He asks her not to execute the captive without a fair trial , and she agrees with him . Mossador goes against her wishes , and kills the captive Son of the Harpy . Daenerys has him publicly executed , which leads a riot to break out between the old masters and the freed slaves . At night , Daenerys finds that Drogon has returned , but when she tries to touch his face , he flies away . Soon afterward , a group of Unsullied patrolling the streets of Meereen are stopped by a crying woman who points them to an alleyway . The Unsullied head in to investigate , but it is revealed that the entire affair was a set up after they are soon cornered by a group of the Sons of the Harpy . The Unsullied attempt to fight back , but the Sons of the Harpy kill many of them . Barristan Selmy sees the commotion and tries to help , killing many of the Sons of the Harpy , but gets badly wounded , and dies . Grey Worm also sustains serious but nonfatal injuries . Daenerys is furious after learning what has happened to Barristan , and rounds up the leaders of the great Meereenese houses . She takes them into the catacombs where she randomly has one of them shoved forward . The Meereenese lord is promptly killed by dragonfire from Rhaegal , and he and Viserion eat him . Daenerys then has all the lords arrested , including her former adviser Hizdahr zo Loraq , whom she decides to marry to win over the Meereenese nobles . To respect the culture of the region , she agrees to have the fighting pits reinstated ( she had previously declined due to her distaste for killing for sport ) . Hizdahr convinces Daenerys to go to one of the pits to see the contestants battling over who will go to the final competition . Daenerys is sickened by the bloodshed , and gets up to leave , but her attention is turned by one masked competitor who defeats all of the other competitors without killing any of them . This competitor turns out to be Jorah Mormont , who is trying to win over Daenerys ' favor after being banished . Daenerys orders the Unsullied to take him away , but Jorah announces that he has brought her a gift , and Tyrion Lannister reveals himself to Daenerys . After a round of questioning , Daenerys banishes Jorah once again , but takes Tyrion on as her adviser . On the great opening of Daznak 's Pit , Jorah resurfaces as a voluntary contender on the arena , but Daenerys refuses to stop the games to spare his life . Jorah eventually prevails and saves her life by impaling with his spear an attacker from the Sons of the Harpy , who appear in legions and attack Daenerys ' guards . Cornered at the midst of the arena , defeat seems immediate when Drogon returns , killing many Sons of the Harpy despite being wounded by several of their spears . Daenerys manages to rekindle their bond and climbs his back , riding off into the distance to a stunned crowd . She roams the Great Steppe north of the city , where Drogon seems reluctant to obey her commands or even hunt for food . Strolling about on her own , Daenerys is faced with an incoming Dothraki khalasar of great numbers , and after dropping a ring to the ground to leave a trail , she is surrounded . In season 6 , the Dothraki take her to Vaes Dothrak , where she identifies herself to Khal Moro as Drogo 's former wife . Out of respect for Dothraki traditions , they take Daenerys to join the Dosh Khaleen , which consisted of the wives of deceased khals . Daenerys refuses and instead burns the temple down with herself and all the khals still inside . She emerges unscathed , and the awed Dothraki accept her as their new leader . She returns to Meereen with her new army and destroys the slaver fleet assaulting the city with her dragons . In the aftermath , Daenerys meets with Theon and Yara Greyjoy , who offer their support for her claim so that they can overthrow their uncle Euron . Daenerys accepts their aid and secures help from the Reach and Dorne , names Tyrion as her hand , but breaks up with Daario , ordering him to stay behind and govern Slaver 's Bay in her absence . With her new army , Daenerys finally sets sail for Westeros . In Season 7 Daenerys finally uses her dragons in battle , annihilating a Lannister force and their baggage train with fire . Daenerys welcomes Jon Snow to Dragonstone , seeing him as a friend and ally , insisting that he bend the knee to her but exhibiting patience with his refusal . She believes his tales of white walkers and agrees to let him mine dragonglass ( obsidian ) from her land . When Jon 's expedition north of the Wall gets into trouble Daenerys takes her dragons to rescue them , and is devastated when the Night King kills one . On the ship back to Dragonstone she and Jon make love .",

Forced to find an alternative location after the loss of the Thirteen Colonies in 1783 , the British government turned to the newly discovered lands of Australia . The western coast of Australia had been discovered for Europeans by the Dutch explorer Willem Janszoon in 1606 and was later named New Holland by the Dutch East India Company , but there was no attempt to colonise it . In 1770 James Cook discovered the eastern coast of Australia while on a scientific voyage to the South Pacific Ocean , claimed the continent for Britain , and named it New South Wales . In 1778 , Joseph Banks , Cook 's botanist on the voyage , presented evidence to the government on the suitability of Botany Bay for the establishment of a penal settlement , and in 1787 the first shipment of convicts set sail , arriving in 1788 . Britain continued to transport convicts to New South Wales until 1840 . The Australian colonies became profitable exporters of wool and gold , mainly because of gold rushes in the colony of Victoria , making its capital Melbourne for a time the richest city in the world and the second largest city ( after London ) in the British Empire .",

Following the breakthrough of the title track 's success , the song , written solely by Gaye , became regarded as one of popular music 's most poignant anthems of sorrow regarding the environment . Led by Gaye playing piano , strings conducted by Paul Riser and David Van De Pitte , multi-tracking vocals from Gaye and The Andantes , multiple background instruments provided by The Funk Brothers and a leading sax solo by Wild Bill Moore , the song rose to number 4 on Billboard 's Pop Singles chart and number one for two weeks on the R&B Singles charts on August 14 through to August 27 , 1971 . The distinctive percussive sound heard on the track was a wood block struck by a rubber mallet , drenched in studio reverb . The song also brought Gaye one of his rare appearances on the Adult Contemporary chart , where it peaked at number 34 . In Canada , `` Mercy Mercy Me '' spent two weeks at number 9 .",

Some members of the Women 's Social and Political Union ( WSPU , commonly referred to as suffragettes ) had been imprisoned for acts of vandalism in support of women 's suffrage . In protest to being imprisoned some of these suffragettes undertook hunger strikes . These suffragettes were then force - fed leading to a public outcry . This act was a response to the outcry ; it allowed the prisoners to be released on licence as soon as the hunger strike affected their health . They then had a period of time in which they could recover . After a predetermined period of time the prisoner would be rearrested to serve out the rest of their sentence . Conditions could be placed on the prisoner during the time of their release . The hunger strikes themselves were now technically legal . However , the Act allowed for the re-imprisonment of the hunger strikers upon their recovery on their original charges . The nickname of the Act came about because of a cat 's habit of playing with its prey ( a mouse ) before finishing it off .",

    "paragraph_text": "These rings are typically made of yellow or white gold with diamonds . They usually include the team name , team logo , and Super Bowl number ( usually indicated in Roman numerals ) . The NFL contributes up to $5,000 per ring for up to 150 rings for o the winning team ; any additional costs are borne by the team . Most rings are manufactured by memorabilia company Jostens . In 2015 , the rings for the New England Patriots reportedly cost $36,500 each , making them the most expensive rings Jostens has ever produced . The winning team can typically present rings to whomever they choose , including usually , but not limited to : players ( active roster or injured ) , coaches , trainers , executives , personnel , and general staff . Some teams have given rings to former players and coaches that were on the team at some point during the season , despite not having been on the winning roster for the Super Bowl itself . Sometimes a team will give rings to fans as part of a charity raffle . Teams can distribute any number of rings . A recent trend over the last 15 -- 20 years has been lesser rings awarded to front office staff . These are commonly called `` B '' and `` C '' level rings and are smaller and contain fewer diamonds or contain faux diamonds . The first instance of this was the Redskins Super Bowl XVII ring when many in the front office received rings that were not solid gold and contained cubic zirconia stones ( which resemble diamonds ) . When Tampa Bay won Super Bowl XXXVII , the players and coaches received rings with a diamond - centered Lombardi trophy . Some staff received rings with a metal Lombardi trophy and real diamonds surrounding the trophy and the `` C '' level ring did not contain any diamonds .",

Apart from an Anglophile element urging early support for the British , American public opinion reflected that of the president : the sentiment for neutrality was particularly strong among Irish Americans , German Americans and Scandinavian Americans , as well as among church leaders and among women in general . On the other hand , even before World War I had broken out , American opinion had been more negative toward Germany than towards any other country in Europe . Over time , especially after reports of atrocities in Belgium in 1914 and following the sinking of the passenger liner RMS Lusitania in 1915 , the American citizens increasingly came to see Germany as the aggressor in Europe .",

It set up the Higher Education Contributions Scheme ( HECS ) , which was first proposed by Professor Murray Wells and subsequently developed by economist and lecturer at the Australian National University , Bruce Chapman and championed by Education Minister John Dawkins ( see Dawkins Revolution ) . Under the original HECS , a $1,800 fee was charged to all university students , and the Commonwealth paid the balance . A student could defer payment of this HECS amount ( in which case it was called a HECS debt ) and repay the debt through the tax system , when the student 's income exceeds a threshold level . As part of the reforms , Colleges of Advanced Education entered the University sector by various means . The HECS system was accepted by both federal political parties and has survived until today , though with a number of changes .",

    "paragraph_text": "In the Romantic period , music became more expressive and emotional , expanding to encompass literary , artistic , and philosophical themes . Famous early Romantic composers include Beethoven ( whose works span both this period and the preceding Classical period ) , Schubert , Schumann , Chopin , Mendelssohn , Bellini , and Berlioz . The late 19th century saw a dramatic expansion in the size of the orchestra and in the dynamic range and diversity of instruments used in this ensemble . Also , public concerts became a key part of urban middle class society , in contrast to earlier periods , when concerts were mainly paid for by and performed for aristocrats . Famous composers from the second half of the century include Bruckner , Johann Strauss II , Brahms , Liszt , Tchaikovsky , Dvo\u0159\u00e1k , Verdi , and Wagner . Between 1890 and 1910 , a third wave of composers including Mahler , Richard Strauss , Puccini , and Sibelius built on the work of middle Romantic composers to create even more complex -- and often much longer -- musical works . A prominent mark of late 19th century music is its nationalistic fervor , as exemplified by such figures as Dvo\u0159\u00e1k , Sibelius , and Grieg . Other prominent late - century figures include Saint - Sa\u00ebns , Faur\u00e9 , Rachmaninoff and Franck .",

Combustion in a fire produces a flame , and the heat produced can make combustion self - sustaining . Combustion is often a complicated sequence of elementary radical reactions . Solid fuels , such as wood and coal , first undergo endothermic pyrolysis to produce gaseous fuels whose combustion then supplies the heat required to produce more of them . Combustion is often hot enough that light in the form of either glowing or a flame is produced . A simple example can be seen in the combustion of hydrogen and oxygen into water vapor , a reaction commonly used to fuel rocket engines .

The controlled synthesis of materials as thin films ( a process referred to as deposition ) is a fundamental step in many applications . A familiar example is the household mirror , which typically has a thin metal coating on the back of a sheet of glass to form a reflective interface . The process of silvering was once commonly used to produce mirrors , while more recently the metal layer is deposited using techniques such as sputtering . Advances in thin film deposition techniques during the 20th century have enabled a wide range of technological breakthroughs in areas such as magnetic recording media , electronic semiconductor devices , LEDs , optical coatings ( such as antireflective coatings ) , hard coatings on cutting tools , and for both energy generation ( e.g. thin - film solar cells ) and storage ( thin - film batteries ) . It is also being applied to pharmaceuticals , via thin - film drug delivery . A stack of thin films is called a multilayer .",

    "paragraph_text": "Cooling towers originated in the 19th century through the development of condensers for use with the steam engine . Condensers use relatively cool water , via various means , to condense the steam coming out of the cylinders or turbines . This reduces the back pressure , which in turn reduces the steam consumption , and thus the fuel consumption , while at the same time increasing power and recycling boiler - water . However the condensers require an ample supply of cooling water , without which they are impractical . The consumption of cooling water by inland processing and power plants is estimated to reduce power availability for the majority of thermal power plants by 2040 -- 2069 . While water usage is not an issue with marine engines , it forms a significant limitation for many land - based systems .",

Primarily a freight railway , the CPR was for decades the only practical means of long - distance passenger transport in most regions of Canada , and was instrumental in the settlement and development of Western Canada . The CPR became one of the largest and most powerful companies in Canada , a position it held as late as 1975 . Its primary passenger services were eliminated in 1986 , after being assumed by Via Rail Canada in 1978 . A beaver was chosen as the railway 's logo in honor of Sir Donald A Smith ( 1st . Baron Strathcona and Mount Royal ) who had risen from Factor to Govenor of the Hudson 's Bay Company over a lengthy career in the beaver fur trade . Smith was a principal financier of the C.P.R. staking much of his personal wealth . In 1885 he drove the last spike to complete the transcontinental line .",

During the fourth season , Brenda is interested in the drama department but it also led to problems : she spoiled her first audition and then went to the director of the play to try again and convince him . She then got the role , but a student made a rumor saying that she had slept to have the role . Unfortunately , this student was the girlfriend of Steve Sanders and the latter believed the rumors , others refusing more or less to believe the denials of Brenda . Steve understood his mistake when the student asked him to attack Brenda to make her miss rehearsals . A little later , Steve 's friend tried to commit suicide , but Brenda and Steve joined forces to save her and Steve was finally compensated by following Brenda 's debut on stage . The director 's praise led her to accept the latter at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts ( RADA ) in London for a year . After Kelly and Dylan last broke up , Brenda finally learned that a relationship was possible between Kelly and Brandon and expressed her blessing . She later spent her last night with Dylan , telling her she would not be gone forever . The couple will reconcile briefly in the final scene of the fourth season , though ( because of Shannen Doherty 's departure ) Brenda 's character was removed from the script and she never returned to Beverly Hills .",

In July 1823 , he was condemned to death for the 40 - sous theft and the escape from the jail in Montreuil - sur - Mer , as the prosecutor claims that Valjean was part of a gang of street robbers and the latter refuses to defend himself . His sentence was graciously reduced by the king to only life in prison instead of death . Before he was captured , Jean Valjean had already traveled near to Montfermeil and buried all the money he 'd saved as M.

    "paragraph_text": "The Bantu Education Act , 1953 ( Act No. 47 of 1953 ; later renamed the Black Education Act , 1953 ) was a South African segregation law which legalised several aspects of the apartheid system . Its major provision was enforcing racially separated educational facilities . Even universities were made `` tribal '' , and all but three missionary schools chose to close down when the government no longer would help support their schools . Very few authorities continued using their own finances to support education for native Africans . In 1959 , this type of education was extended to `` non white '' universities and colleges with the Extension of University Education Act , and the internationally prestigious University College of Fort Hare was taken over by the government and degraded to being part of the Bantu education system . It is often argued that the policy of Bantu ( African ) education was aimed to direct black or non-white youth to the unskilled labour market , although Hendrik Verwoerd , at the time Minister of Native Affairs , claimed that the aim was to solve South Africa 's `` ethnic problems '' by creating complementary economic and political units for different ethnic groups .",

Engelmann and Obst ( 1981 ) list the average venom yield at 420 mg ( dry weight ) . Accordingly , large quantities of antivenom may be needed to reverse the progression of symptoms developed if bitten by a king cobra . The toxins affect the victim 's central nervous system , resulting in severe pain , blurred vision , vertigo , drowsiness , and eventually paralysis . If the envenomation is serious , it progresses to cardiovascular collapse , and the victim falls into a coma . Death soon follows due to respiratory failure . Bites from a king cobra may result in a rapid fatality which can be as early as 30 minutes after the envenomation . The king cobra 's envenomation was even recorded to be capable of killing elephants within hours .",

The basic design of the draft is that each team is given a position in the drafting order in reverse order relative to its record in the previous year , which means that the last place team is positioned first . From this position , the team can either select a player or trade their position to another team for other draft positions , a player or players , or any combination thereof . The round is complete when each team has either selected a player or traded its draft position . Certain aspects of the draft , including team positioning and the number of rounds in the draft , have seen revisions since its first creation in 1936 , but the fundamental methodology has remained the same . Currently the draft consists of seven rounds . The original rationale in creating the draft was to increase the competitive parity between the teams as the worst team would , ideally , have chosen the best player available .",

The news of gold brought some 300,000 people to California from the rest of the United States and abroad . The sudden influx of immigration and gold into the money supply reinvigorated the American economy , and California became one of the few American states to go directly to statehood without first being a territory , in the Compromise of 1850 . The Gold Rush had severe effects on Native Californians and resulted in a precipitous population decline from disease , genocide and starvation . By the time it ended , California had gone from a thinly populated ex-Mexican territory to the home state of the first nominee for the Republican Party .",

They are particularly prized in Chinese culture due to their rarity , and supposedly high nutritional value and exquisite flavor . Edible bird 's nests are among the most expensive animal products consumed by humans , with nests being sold recently at prices up to about US $ 2,000 per kilogram , depending on grading . The type or grading of bird 's nest depends on the type of bird as well as the diet of the bird . It differs in colour from white to dark brown . The Chinese believe that it promotes good health , especially for the skin . The nests have been used in Chinese cooking for over 400 years , most often as bird 's nest soup .",

Part - time jobs are mistakenly thought by some to not be careers . However , legislation exists to stop employers from discriminating against part - time workers so this should not be a factor when making decisions on career advancement . They generally pay more than part - time jobs per hour , and this is similarly discriminatory if the pay decision is based on part - time status as a primary factor . The Fair Labor Standards Act ( FLSA ) does not define full - time employment or part - time employment . This is a matter generally to be determined by the employer ( US Department of Labor ) . The definition by employer can vary and is generally published in a company 's Employee Handbook .

He is then lead upstairs to be strapped into a chair and interrogated by a woman ( Joanna Moskawa ) who seems to have an aggression towards him . As this is happening , ghostly images of the band perform in front of each member , the video also features these images solo inside an abandoned warehouse including Taylor . Taylor is then blindfolded and then a weird screen is brought out . Corey then walks into the room from the shadows , with a shaved head , wearing a suit and sunglasses . He takes the sunglasses off and then the blindfold is removed , revealing the woman from before . At the end of the solo and the final `` everything to '' shaved Corey presses the button and the other Corey is then seen singing on the screen . The lady panics from this sight and the rest of the band have smiles on their faces . At the end of the video the band leaves the lady tied . Right before it fades to black , the screen says `` What did you see ? '' This was part of a contest that the band held to see the concept of the video , which had a code which read `` I am you '' which explains the fact Corey was replaced with the woman .",

The political objective of the assassination was to break off Austria - Hungary 's South Slav provinces so they could be combined into a Yugoslavia . The assassins ' motives were consistent with the movement that later became known as Young Bosnia . The assassination led directly to the First World War when Austria - Hungary subsequently issued an ultimatum to the Kingdom of Serbia , which was partially rejected .

An episode typically ends as a cliffhanger showing the first few moments of Sam 's next leap ( along with him again uttering `` Oh , boy ! '' on discovering his situation ) , which is repeated in the following episode 's cold open . Though initially Sam 's leaping is believed by Al and the others on the Quantum Leap team to be random , the characters come to believe in later seasons that someone or something is controlling Sam 's leaping , and this is a central focus of the show 's finale episode , `` Mirror Image '' .",

Gutenberg 's most important innovation was the development of hand - molded metal printing matrices , thus producing a movable type based printing press system . His newly devised hand mould made possible the precise and rapid creation of metal movable type in large quantities . Movable type had been hitherto unknown in Europe . In Europe , the two inventions , the hand mould and the printing press , together drastically reduced the cost of printing books and other documents , particularly in short print runs .",

The woolly mammoth was well adapted to the cold environment during the last ice age . It was covered in fur , with an outer covering of long guard hairs and a shorter undercoat . The colour of the coat varied from dark to light . The ears and tail were short to minimise frostbite and heat loss . It had long , curved tusks and four molars , which were replaced six times during the lifetime of an individual . Its behaviour was similar to that of modern elephants , and it used its tusks and trunk for manipulating objects , fighting , and foraging . The diet of the woolly mammoth was mainly grass and sedges . Individuals could probably reach the age of 60 . Its habitat was the mammoth steppe , which stretched across northern Eurasia and North America .",

De Beers ' market share of rough diamonds fell from as high as 90 % in the 1980s to 33 % in 2013 , because of a more fragmented diamond market bringing greater competition , as well as more transparency and greater liquidity . In November 2011 , the Oppenheimer family announced its intention to sell all its 40 % stake in De Beers to Anglo American plc , thereby increasing Anglo American 's ownership of the company to 85 % ( the other 15 % is owned by the Government of the Republic of Botswana ) .

    "paragraph_text": "The Red Knob amplifiers were produced from 1987 until 1993 . These were some of the first models produced by the newly formed Fender Musical Instrument Corporation . These amplifiers , named for their bright red control knobs , have a slightly similar appearance to the older Blackface cosmetics , having black control panels with white lettering and the late 1970s `` scripted tailless '' Fender logo . Many of these models were simply refitted with black knobs and early 1970s `` unscripted tailless '' Fender logos in 1996 when most Fender amplifier manufacturing moved to the Ensenada factory in Mexico . This series of amplifiers all used printed circuit board construction and can be difficult for amateur amp techs to service . The Red Knob amps , with their high - gain channels , had their own sound , not much like the older classic Blackface and Silverface designs .",

    "paragraph_text": "By 2004 , 58 receptor tyrosine kinases ( RTKs ) were known , grouped into 20 subfamilies . They play pivotal roles in diverse cellular activities including growth ( by signaling neurotrophins ) , differentiation , metabolism , adhesion , motility , death . RTKs are composed of an extracellular domain , which is able to bind a specific ligand , a transmembrane domain , and an intracellular catalytic domain , which is able to bind and phosphorylate selected substrates . Binding of a ligand to the extracellular region causes a series of structural rearrangements in the RTK that lead to its enzymatic activation . In particular , movement of some parts of the kinase domain gives free access to adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) and the substrate to the active site . This triggers a cascade of events through phosphorylation of intracellular proteins that ultimately transmit ( `` transduce '' ) the extracellular signal to the nucleus , causing changes in gene expression . Many RTKs are involved in oncogenesis , either by gene mutation , or chromosome translocation , or simply by over-expression . In every case , the result is a hyper - active kinase , that confers an aberrant , ligand - independent , non-regulated growth stimulus to the cancer cells .",

On the night after the Battle of Slivnitza , a Swiss mercenary soldier in the Serbian army , Captain Bluntschli , climbs in through her bedroom balcony window and threatens to shoot Raina if she gives the alarm . When Russian and Bulgarian troops burst in to search the house for him , Raina hides him so that he wo n't be killed . He asks her to remember that `` nine soldiers out of ten are born fools . '' In a conversation after the soldiers have left , Bluntschli 's pragmatic and cynical attitude towards war and soldiering shocks the idealistic Raina , especially after he admits that he uses his ammunition pouches to carry chocolates rather than cartridges for his pistol . When the search dies down , Raina and her mother Catherine sneak Bluntschli out of the house , disguised in one of Raina 's father 's old coats .",

American fears of the Native Americans ended , as did British plans to create a buffer Native American state . The American quest for honor after its humiliations by the British were satisfied . The final collapse of the opposition Federalist Party opened an `` Era of good feelings '' with lessened partisanship and an exuberant spirit . The British paid little attention to the war , concentrating instead on their final defeat of Napoleon in 1815 . The U.S. failed to gain any territory from British North America , contrary to many American politicians ' hopes and expectations , but it did gain land from Spain .",

Derek explains that Mark had an affair with his wife , Addison ( Kate Walsh ) while they were living in New York . Mark travels to Seattle , intent on convincing Addison to return with him , but his offer is rejected and Derek declines to renew their friendship . Mark returns during season three at Addison 's drunken behest , but she again rejects him once sober . Undeterred , Mark sells his successful private practice ( which he previously shared with Derek ) and takes over the plastics program at Seattle Grace Hospital . During Meredith 's morphine rampage , Mark finds out about his nickname McSteamy which was given to him by her during his first trip to Seattle back when he attempted to get Addison back and earn Derek 's friendship back . It is later revealed that Mark has at some point slept with all of Derek 's sisters . Mark has a brief fling with Addison 's friend , orthopedic surgeon Callie Torres ( Sara Ramirez ) , and develops a friendship with Derek 's girlfriend , intern Meredith Grey ( Ellen Pompeo ) . It is revealed that after Derek left New York , Mark and Addison continued their relationship for two months , during which she conceived and aborted his child . Just weeks after moving to Seattle he quickly observes that Derek 's true love was Meredith and tries to convince Addison that her marriage with Derek was over . Mark enters into a sixty - day abstinence pact with Addison , agreeing that if they can remain celibate for that time , Addison will give their relationship another chance . Addison ultimately breaks the pact by having sex with intern Alex Karev ( Justin Chambers ) , and soon thereafter departs from Seattle to work in Los Angeles .",

The team is scheduled to begin play as the Las Vegas Raiders for the 2020 National Football League ( NFL ) season ( although a move to Las Vegas could happen as soon as 2019 with Sam Boyd Stadium ) , playing home games at the Las Vegas Stadium . NFL team owners voted 31 -- 1 to approve the move , which was announced at the annual league meetings in Phoenix , Arizona on March 27 , 2017 . The Raiders became the third NFL franchise to relocate in the 2010s , following the Rams ' move from St. Louis , Missouri to Los Angeles , California on January 12 , 2016 , and the Chargers ' move from San Diego , California to Los Angeles on January 12 , 2017 . The Raiders ' move to Las Vegas comes after years of failed efforts to renovate or replace the Oakland -- Alameda County Coliseum , which has been rated by multiple sources as one of the worst stadiums in the NFL .",

Although the country spent two months with declining GDP , it was not until the Wall Street Crash in October 1929 that the effects of a declining economy were felt , and a major worldwide economic downturn ensued . The market crash marked the beginning of a decade of high unemployment , poverty , low profits , deflation , plunging farm incomes , and lost opportunities for economic growth and personal advancement . Although its causes are still uncertain and controversial , the net effect was a sudden and general loss of confidence in the economic future .",

While other inventors had produced devices that could record sounds , Edison 's phonograph was the first to be able to reproduce the recorded sound . His phonograph originally recorded sound onto a tinfoil sheet wrapped around a rotating cylinder . A stylus responding to sound vibrations produced an up and down or hill - and - dale groove in the foil . Alexander Graham Bell 's Volta Laboratory made several improvements in the 1880s and introduced the graphophone , including the use of wax - coated cardboard cylinders and a cutting stylus that moved from side to side in a zig zag groove around the record . In the 1890s , Emile Berliner initiated the transition from phonograph cylinders to flat discs with a spiral groove running from the periphery to near the center , coining the term gramophone for disc record players , which is predominantly used in many languages . Later improvements through the years included modifications to the turntable and its drive system , the stylus or needle , and the sound and equalization systems .",

Antonio Ortiz wrote `` Take My Hand '' . A number of critics noted the unusually high quality of many of the individual songs on the soundtrack , how well they reflected the styles and times they were attempting to parody , and how well they stood on their own as quality compositions .

    "paragraph_text": "Before 1986 , people often did not obtain a Social Security number until the age of about 14 , since the numbers were used for income tracking purposes , and those under that age seldom had substantial income . The Tax Reform Act of 1986 required parents to list Social Security numbers for each dependent over the age of 5 for whom the parent wanted to claim a tax deduction . Before this act , parents claiming tax deductions were simply trusted not to lie about the number of children they supported . During the first year of the Tax Reform Act , this anti-fraud change resulted in seven million fewer minor dependents being claimed . The disappearance of these dependents is believed to have involved either children who never existed or tax deductions improperly claimed by non-custodial parents . In 1988 , the threshold was lowered to 2 years old , and in 1990 , the threshold was lowered yet again to 1 year old . Today , an SSN is required regardless of the child 's age to receive an exemption . Since then , parents have often applied for Social Security numbers for their children soon after birth ; today , it can be done on the application for a birth certificate .",
