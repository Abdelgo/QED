On June 30 , 1945 , before ENIAC was made , mathematician John von Neumann distributed the paper entitled First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC . It was the outline of a stored - program computer that would eventually be completed in August 1949 . EDVAC was designed to perform a certain number of instructions ( or operations ) of various types . Significantly , the programs written for EDVAC were to be stored in high - speed computer memory rather than specified by the physical wiring of the computer . This overcame a severe limitation of ENIAC , which was the considerable time and effort required to reconfigure the computer to perform a new task . With von Neumann 's design , the program that EDVAC ran could be changed simply by changing the contents of the memory . EDVAC , however , was not the first stored - program computer ; the Manchester Small - Scale Experimental Machine , a small prototype stored - program computer , ran its first program on 21 June 1948 and the Manchester Mark 1 ran its first program during the night of 16 -- 17 June 1949 .", "question_text": "who developed the central processing unit (cpu)", "title_text": "Central processing unit", "answer_spans": [[253, 269]], "answer_text": ["John von Neumann"], "annotation": [], "sentence_starts": [0, 195, 340, 442, 542, 702, 851, 972], "answer_type": "multi_sentence"}

Scott is also connected to another classmate named Louden , who is better known as Mouth . Scott tries every attempt to get Julia 's attention such as joining the school paper , because he thinks that she is part of the staff , only to discover that she has written only a single column for the paper . He then runs for student council , after finding out that Julia is also running as well , and wins a seat , only to find out that she has not won . Because of this , Scott resigns from his position on the student council . It turns out that a lot of other members also resigned including the president meaning Julia who happened to have the 2nd most amount of votes is now president . He also auditions for the school play and is selected as a member of the crew , thinking that Julia is also auditioning for the play . However , Julia has not been selected as a member of the cast or crew . Soon , a new girl named Lee arrives at school , who wears face pins and weird clothes , and has wildly colored hair . Both soon realize that they share the same interests , but he ca n't get past his crush on Julia . Scott suddenly has another `` friend '' named Wesley , a high school senior . Though they share some interests , they have little in common . Then to put the cherry on top of all this excitement going on in his life , his mother announces that she is pregnant .

Later , he learns that not everything is what it seems once he finds out that his older brother , Bobby , who is struggling to find a job , can barely read .
