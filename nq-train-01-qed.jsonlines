There were however centres which focused on helping abandoned children and offering care in hopes that these children might survive into adulthood . Some examples include orphanages , dispensaries , and foundling hospitals . Florence 's Hospital of the Innocent ( Ospedale degli Innocenti ) was originally a charity based orphanage which opened in 1445 ; its aim was to nurse sick and abandoned infants back to health . A later example and better established institution whose goal it was to help rehabilitate infants was the Foundling Hospital founded by Thomas Coram in 1741 . Foundling hospitals were set up to receive abandoned infants , nurse them back to health , teach them a trade or skill , and integrate them back into society . Coram 's foundling hospital was revolutionary because it was one of the United Kingdoms first children charities . Moreover , it was largely made successful by the powerful people who donated money to the hospital . Coram 's hospital would eventually be faced with the fact that the number of infants needing care outweighed their hospitals capacity . In order to accommodate the number of children in need , there were attempts to set up similar hospitals throughout the UK ; they ultimately were unsuccessful due to the lack of funding . Simultaneously , dispensaries which were also funded by donations were being opened in order to provide medicine and medical attention to those who could not afford private care . Dispensaries and foundling hospitals were the earliest forms of what would later become children 's hospitals . The establishing of the Foundling Hospital by Thomas Coram was a direct response to the high infant mortality rate in London , England . Although foundling hospitals acknowledged the high infant mortality rate , infant mortality would not be addressed in a wide spread way until the early 19th century when children 's hospitals would begin to open in Vienna , Moscow , Prague , Berlin , and various other major cities throughout Europe .", "question_text": "when was the first children's hospital built", "title_text": "Children's hospital", "answer_spans": [[854, 858]], "answer_text": ["1741"], "annotation": [], "sentence_starts": [0, 282, 431, 507, 702, 861, 1021, 1136, 1237, 1373, 1561, 1741, 1853, 1990], "answer_type": "multi_sentence"}

When Carey became host , there was talk of the show traveling in the future . The program is usually produced in about an hour , although if there is a guest involved , some tapings will last longer because of question and answer sessions by the audience and the guest , which the host usually moderates .

Drake drilled the world 's first oil well in 1859 at Titusville , Pennsylvania , USA , history registered another exploration of the black liquid gold , in the largest continent . More than a century ago , history was made in a remote corner of Assam in the midst of the dense and malaria infested jungles , by a band of intrepid pioneers searching for black gold . In 1867 Italian Engineers , commissioned by the Assam Railways and Trading Company , to build a railway line from Dibrugarh to Margherita ( Headquarters of Assam Railways and Trading Company ) accidentally discovered oil at Digboi around 10 miles from Margherita . ' Dig boy , dig ' , shouted the English engineer , Mr WL Lake , elephants emerging out of the dense forest with oil stains on their feet '' .

Two events separated by seven years have become fused , but although neither is likely to be provable , such evidence that does exist appears sufficiently detailed to be credible . Various web sites offer variations on the elephant 's foot story , a consensus of which would be that engineers extending the Dibru - Sadiya railway line to Ledo for the Assam Railways and Trading Company ( AR&TC ) in 1882 were using elephants for haulage and noticed that the mud on one pachyderm 's feet smelled of oil . Retracing the trail of footprints , they found oil seeping to the surface . One of the engineers , the Englishman Willie Leova Lake , was an ' oil enthusiast ' and persuaded the company to drill a well . Oil India Ltd makes no reference to elephants ' feet in its company history , although on its previous web site the company noted that Lake had noticed `` the oil seepages around Borbhil '' . Once the project had been approved , Lake assembled equipment , boilers , and local labour , and engaged elephants to haul the machinery to the site . The first well was started in September 1889 , but an encouraging first strike at 178 feet ( 54 m ) turned out to be a small pocket , and drilling recommenced . This continued until November 1890 when the well was completed at a total depth of 662 feet ( 202 m ) , and it was during this extended period of drilling that Oil India 's old web site placed the legend of Lake exhorting one or more of his labourers to `` Dig , boy !

{"example_id": 4938837966927170785, "paragraph_text": "One of the first mentions of a wall built against northern invaders is found in a poem , dated from the seventh century BC , recorded in the Classic of Poetry . The poem tells of a king , now identified as King Xuan ( r . 827 -- 782 BC ) of the Western Zhou dynasty ( 1046 -- 771 BC ) , who commanded General Nan Zhong ( \u5357\u4ef2 ) to build a wall in the northern regions to fend off the Xianyun . The Xianyun , whose base of power was in the Ordos region , were regarded as part of the charioteering Rong tribes , and their attacks aimed at the early Zhou capital region of Haojing were probably the reason for King Xuan 's response . Nan Zhong 's campaign was recorded as a great victory . However , only a few years later in 771 BC another branch of the Rong people , the Quanrong , responded to a summons by the renegade Marquess of Shen by over-running the Zhou defences and laying waste to the capital . The cataclysmic event killed King Xuan 's successor King You ( 795 -- 771 BC ) , forced the court to move the capital east to Chengzhou ( \u6210 \u5468 , later known as Luoyang ) a year later , and thus ushered in the Eastern Zhou dynasty ( 770 -- 256 BC ) . Most importantly , the fall of Western Zhou redistributed power to the states that had acknowledged Zhou 's nominal rulership . The rule of the Eastern Zhou dynasty was marked by bloody interstate anarchy . With smaller states being annexed and larger states waging constant war upon one another , many rulers came to feel the need to erect walls to protect their borders . Of the earliest textual reference to such a wall was the State of Chu 's wall of 656 BC , 1,400 metres ( 4,600 feet ) of which were excavated in southern Henan province in the modern era . The State of Qi also had fortified borders up by the 7th century BC , and the extant portions in Shandong province had been christened the Great Wall of Qi . The State of Wei built two walls , the western one completed in 361 BC and the eastern in 356 BC , with the extant western wall found in Hancheng , Shaanxi .

Each ball 's kinetic energy - as indicated by the quantity of material displaced - was shown to be proportional to the square of the velocity . The deformation of the clay was found to be directly proportional to the height the balls were dropped from , equal to the initial potential energy . Earlier workers , including Newton and Voltaire , had all believed that `` energy '' ( so far as they understood the concept at all ) was not distinct from momentum and therefore proportional to velocity .

One of these designs , which gained the nickname of the 1966 `` Brown Box '' , featured changeable game modes and was demonstrated to several TV manufacturers , ultimately leading to an agreement between Sanders Associates and Magnavox . In 1972 , Magnavox released the Magnavox Odyssey , the first home video game console which could be connected to a TV set . Ralph Baer 's initial design had called for a huge row of switches that would allow players to turn on and off certain components of the console ( the Odyssey lacked a CPU ) to create slightly different games like tennis , volleyball , hockey , and chase . Magnavox replaced the switch design with separate cartridges for each game .

Dick Clark had advised Darin not to record the song because of the perception that , having come from an opera , it would not appeal to the rock and roll audience . In subsequent years , Clark recounted the story with good humor . Frank Sinatra , who recorded the song with Quincy Jones on his L.A. Is My Lady album , called Darin 's the `` definitive '' version . Billboard ranked this version as the No. 2 song for 1959 . Darin 's version was No. 3 on Billboard 's All Time Top 100 . In 2003 , the Darin version was ranked # 251 on Rolling Stone 's `` 500 Greatest Songs of All Time '' list . On BBC Radio 4 's Desert Island Discs , pop mogul Simon Cowell named `` Mack the Knife '' the best song ever written .
